##***<u>Lesson 8: What’s the Trend?</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will understand that the regression line is a model for a linear association (trend). They will learn
to identify the direction and strength of trends.

###**Materials:**
1. *What’s the Trend?* handout ([LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend.pdf))

    **<u>Note:</u>** This handout will be referenced and used in subsequent lessons.

2. *Strength of Association* handout ([LMR_4.8_Strength of Association](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.8_Strength of Association.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
trend, positive association, negative association, no association, shape, linear, model, strength of
association

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    Associations are important because they help us make better predictions; the stronger the
    trend, the better the prediction we can make. “Better” in this case means that our mean squared residuals can
    be made smaller.

###**Lesson:**
1. Distribute *What’s the Trend?* ([LMR_4.7](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend.pdf)). Students will analyze the two scatterplots on the
handout. The *Profits per Explosion* plot shows the relationship between the number of explosions
in Michael Bay’s movies and the profit earned by each movie. The *Scores Over Time* plot shows
the relationship between M. Night Shyamalan movies made since *The Sixth Sense* was released
in 1999 and their Internet Movie Database (IMBD) scores.

2. In teams, students will discuss and record their responses to the following questions for each plot:

    100. What kind of plot is this? <span style="color:grey">***Scatterplot.***</span>

    100. What do the numbers on the x-axis represent? What do the numbers on the y-axis
    represent? <span style="color:grey">***The x-axis shows number of explosions and y-axis shows profit in
    millions of dollars.***</span>

    100. What is this plot telling us? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. One example could be that if there are
    more explosions in a movie, then the movie will earn a greater profit.***</span>

    100. What kind of plot is this? <span style="color:grey">***Scatterplot.***</span>

    100. What do the numbers on the x-axis represent? What do the numbers on the y-axis
    represent? <span style="color:grey">***The x-axis shows the number of years since 1999 and the y-axis shows
    the movie’s IMDB score.***</span>

    100. What is this plot telling us? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. One example could be that as M. Night
    Shyamalan has produced more movies, their IMDB ratings have gone down.***</span>

3. Allow students time to discuss and record their answers to the questions.

4. Display both plots, if possible (students may also refer to the plots in their own handout). Discuss
the following questions with the whole class:

    * What is happening in each plot? What seems to be the trend? <span style="color:grey">***Guide students to
    understand that the Profits per Explosion plot shows an increasing ***</span>***trend***<span style="color:grey">***, while the
    Scores Over Time plot shows a decreasing trend. An increasing trend is called a
     ***</span>***positive association***<span style="color:grey">*** and a decreasing trend is called a  ***</span>***negative association***<span style="color:grey">***.***</span>

    * What does it mean to have an increasing trend and a positive association? <span style="color:grey">***In Profits per
    Explosion, it means that as the number of explosions increase, the movie profits also
    increase.***</span>

    * What does it mean to have a decreasing trend and a negative association? <span style="color:grey">***In Scores Over
    Time, it means that as the years after 1999 pass, the movie IMBD ratings decrease.***</span>

5. Quickwrite: What if we had a plot with **no association**? Ask students to sketch what they think a
scatterplot that shows no association looks like. A correct sketch will show a scatterplot with
data points that show no positive or negative association; no trend or pattern. There
would be no association or a very weak one. The data would be scattered.

6. Select a couple of sketches to share with the whole class. Discuss why the sketches show no
association.

7. Ask students to discuss their thoughts about why a line was drawn through the points of the two
plots and why there are equations for each plot.

8. Conduct a share out of their observations. Guide students to the understanding that the **shape** of
both plots is **linear**. The line represents a *model* for the relationship between two variables. The
equation shown in the plots above represents the line through the points. It provides a description
of the data and the relationship between the variables.

9. Distribute *Strength of Association* ([LMR_4.8_Strength of Association](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.8_Strength of Association.pdf)). In teams, students will
examine the scatterplots (b) through (e). Their task is to discuss the **strength of the association**
for each plot. They will determine which plots they think show strong associations and which ones
they believe show weak associations. They must explain how they made their decision. Reasons
must reference the plots.

10. As an example, demonstrate how to describe plot (a) in the [*Strength of Association*](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.8_Strength of Association.pdf) handout.
<span style="color:grey">***Possible description: Plot (a) shows a negative association, or decreasing trend. The
association appears to be fairly strong because the points are relatively close together,
forming a moderate linear pattern.***</span>

11. Once all teams have completed the handout, assign one plot to each team for a share out. If two
teams have the same plot, one team will share its explanation first and the second team can
agree, disagree, or add to the first team’s description.

12. Guide students to understand that a strong association has points closer to each other and a
weak association has points more scattered.

13. If students run out of time, they will complete the remainder of the activity for homework.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
