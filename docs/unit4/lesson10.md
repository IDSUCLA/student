##***<u>Lesson 10: Predicting Values</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn how to make predictions based on linear models.

###**Materials:**
1. *What’s the Trend?* handout ([LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend.pdf)) from [lesson 8](lesson8.md)

2. *Predicting Values* handout ([LMR_4.10_Predicting Values](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.10_Predicting Values.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
observed value, predicted value

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    The regression line can be used to make good predictions about values of *y* for any given
    value of *x*. This works for exactly the same reason the mean works well for one variable: the predictions will
    make your score on the mean squared residuals as small as possible.

###**Lesson:**
1. Entrance ticket: How do you find the equation of a line using two points?

    **<u>Note to Teacher:</u>** Students may share their responses with a partner or you may choose to use
    this ticket as an assessment.

2. Reveal the equation of the line of best fit for the Arm Span vs. Height data and ask students to
check their equations from the homework assignment:

    <center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widehat{height}=0.7328(armspan)&plus;17.4957" title="\widehat{height}=0.7328(armspan)+17.4957" /></center>

    **<u>Note:</u>** Any time a *hat* is on top of a variable, this means we are making “predicted values” of that
    variable.

3. Whose equation came closest to the equation of the regression line? Ask the student whose
equation came closest to share how he/she came up with the equation.

4. Inform students that the equation of the line is a rule that predicts the height based on a second
variable, in this case, arm span.

5. Team discussion question:

    **Using the equation of the line of best fit provided, how can we predict the height of
    a student whose arm span is 67 inches?**

6. Remind students that lines of best fit are also known as regression lines and they are models that
can be used to make predictions. Today, they will explore more about this line.

7. Ask student teams to refer back to *What’s the Trend?* Handout ([LMR_4.7](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend.pdf)). They should discuss
the following questions and record their responses on the *Predicting Values* handout ([LMR_4.10](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.10_Predicting Values.pdf)):

    100. What do you notice about where the points are and where the line is? <span style="color:grey">***Some points are
    near the line, others are further away, and one point is exactly on the line. Data
    points are ***</span>***observed values***<span style="color:grey">*** and points on the line are ***</span>***predicted values***<span style="color:grey">***.***</span>

    100. Recall from Algebra that every line can be represented by an equation in the form
    y=mx+b. In this case, the equation of the regression line is y=3.2536x+154.3654.
    What do the x- and y-values represent in this equation? <span style="color:grey">***The x-values represent the
    number of explosions and the y-values represent the predicted profit.***</span>

    100. According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean in
    relation to the number of explosions? <span style="color:grey">***The slope is 3.2536. It is the rate of change
    between the number of explosions and the profit. It means that for every explosion
    increase the profit increases by 3.2536 dollars.***</span>

    100. When the number of explosions (x-value) is zero, what is the profit (y-value)? How do you
    know? What does this mean? <span style="color:grey">***The profit is 154.3654 million dollars. Students may
    use the equation to show that they substituted zero for x, so the y-intercept is the
    profit. It means that if Michael Bay were to make a movie with NO explosions, this
    would be his projected profit.***</span>

    100. If you wanted to know the profit for the point that lies the closest to the line, what would
    the equation be? Write the equation and solve it. <span style="color:grey">***Profit=3.2536(211)+154.3654.
    Profit=840.875 or 840,875,000 million dollars.***</span>

    100. What was the actual profit for the point that lies closest to the line? <span style="color:grey">***The actual profit was
    836,303,693 million dollars.***</span>

    100. What if Michael Bay made a movie that had 325 explosions? What would his predicted
    profit be? Show how you arrived at the solution. <span style="color:grey">***By substituting 325 in the value of x in
    the equation, predicted profit will be $1,211, 785, 400 or $ 1, 211.7854, or by finding
    the point on the line or both.***</span>

8. Assign one question to each team for a share out. If two teams have the same question, one
team will share its explanation first and the second team can agree, disagree, or add to the first
team’s explanation.

    **<u>Note:</u>** If students ask/wonder about the meaning of the R<sup>2</sup>, inform them that it is related to R, also
    known as the correlation coefficient. They will learn about R (not R<sup>2</sup>)in [lesson 11](lesson11.md).

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students will answer the following questions about the *Scores Over Time* plot ([LMR_4.7](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.7_What’s the Trend.pdf)):

• What do you notice about where the points are and where the line is?

• What do the y-and x-values represent in this equation?

• According to the equation, what is the slope of this line? What does the slope mean?

• When the x-value is zero, what is the y-value? How do you know? What does this mean?

• What would the predicted value of the score be if M. Night Shyamalan released a movie
in 2015? How do you know?
