##***<u>Lesson 4: Refining the Water Campaign</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will revise their water usage Participatory Sensing campaign according to the finding from the
mock implementation of their campaign to refine it. Student teams will then share their final campaigns
with the rest of the class.

###**Materials:**
1. Posters from previous lesson
2. Markers

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    Statistical questions guide a participatory sensing campaign so that we can learn about a
    community or ourselves. These campaigns should be tried before implementing to make sure they are collecting
    the data they are meant to collect and refined accordingly.


###**Lesson:**
1. Student teams will come together to discuss their findings regarding the mock implementation of
their campaign. Allow them time to share their findings with their team members.

2. Next, ask student teams to discuss the revisions they need to make according to their findings.

3. Once they have made a decision on the revisions, they will reflect these changes on their posters.

4. Now they will edit their campaigns. The Recorder/Reporter will type for his/her team and will login
by going to the IDS Home page and clicking on Campaign Manager.

5. Then, ask students to find their team’s campaign. If the campaign is not visible, they may do a
**Search** by typing in their campaign name.

6. Once the campaign is found, the Recorder/Reporter will click on the drop down menu to the right
of the campaign information and select **Edit Campaign**.

7. On the Campaign Editor, students may scroll down to see their prompts. Students may do the
following actions to the prompts:

    • **<u>Edit:</u>** Click on the prompt’s name to expand and make changes as needed. To close the
    prompt, they may click on the **X** that appears on the expanded prompt.

    • **<u>Delete:</u>** Click on the **X** that appears on the prompt’s name (non-expanded prompt).

    • **<u>Add:</u>** Scroll down to the **+Add Prompt** button.

8. Once finished making the edits/revisions to the campaign, the Reporter/Recorder will change the
**Campaign Status** to **Running** (green).

9. To run the campaign and begin collecting data via the mobile app or web browser, the
Reporter/Recorder will click on **Update Campaign** on the top right hand side of the Campaign
Editor.

10. Ask teams to refresh their campaigns on their smartphones or the web browser to verify that their
campaign appears as one of the choices.

11. Now that they are finished with their campaigns, student teams will share out their campaigns
with the rest of the class by engaging in a Gallery Walk of the posters that show their work.

12. Encourage teams to ask questions or make comments as they visit each poster.

13. Before moving to the next round (from poster to poster), ask the teams if they have questions or
need clarification or would like to make a comment to the team that created the poster. Repeat
until teams have visited all the posters.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students may begin collecting data by implementing their Water Usage Participatory Sensing campaign.
They will have a longer period of time to collect these data—about a month—to ensure they collect a
sufficient amount of data since only the members of their team will be collecting data for their campaign
and not the entire class.
