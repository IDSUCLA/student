##***<u>Lesson 11: How Strong Is It?</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn that the correlation coefficient is a value that measures the strength in linear
associations only.
###**Materials:**
1. *Correlation Coefficient* handout ([LMR_4.11_Correlation Coefficient](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.11_Correlation Coefficient.pdf))

    **<u>Note:</u>** Advance preparation required. This handout is the resource for the plot cutouts. DO NOT
    distribute as-is to students.

###**Vocabulary:**
correlation coefficient

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    A high absolute value for correlation means a strong linear trend. A value close to 0
    means a weak linear trend.


###**Lesson:**
1. Inform students that, so far, they have been labeling associations as strong, very strong, or weak.
A number called the **correlation coefficient** measures strength of association. The correlation
coefficient only applies to linear relationships, which must be checked visually with a scatterplot.
Later we will learn how to calculate this number using RStudio.

    **<u>Note to teacher:</u>** Advance preparation is needed for this lesson. Each team needs one envelope
    with cutouts of plots A-F in [LMR_4.11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.11_Correlation Coefficient.pdf) (Part A). Make envelopes according to the number of
    teams in the class. This process will be repeated for [LMR_4.11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.11_Correlation Coefficient.pdf) (Part B).

2. Distribute the envelopes to the teams. Students will examine the strength of association in each
plot. Their task is to assign the correlation coefficient that corresponds to each plot and to explain
why they assigned that correlation coefficient to that particular plot. The only piece of information
they will receive is that a correlation coefficient equal to 1 has the strongest linear association and
a correlation coefficient equal to 0 has the weakest association.

3. Assign each team one plot. If there are more teams than plots, these teams will be assigned a
plot in the next round. Each team will share the correlation coefficient they assigned to their plot
and the explanation that goes with it.

4. Using the *Voting Cards* strategy (see Instructional Strategies), the rest of the teams will show
whether they approve, disapprove, or are uncertain about the teams’ assignment and/or
explanation. Repeat for each plot. The correlation coefficients for each plot are:

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot A: r = 1.00***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot B: r = 0.72***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot C: r = 0.19***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot D: r = 0.48***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot E: r = 0.98***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot F: r = 0.00***</span>

5. The last set of plots showed positive associations. Now students will assign the correlation
coefficients for plots G-L for [LMR_4.11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.11_Correlation Coefficient.pdf) (Part 2).

6. Distribute the envelopes to the teams. Students will examine the strength of association in each
plot. Their task is to assign the correlation coefficient that corresponds to each plot and to explain
why they assigned that correlation coefficient to that particular plot. The only piece of information
they will receive is that a correlation coefficient equal to -1 has the strongest linear association
and a correlation coefficient equal to 0 has the weakest association.

7. Teams previously not assigned a plot are now assigned one. Each team will share the correlation
coefficient they assigned to their plot and the explanation that goes with it.

8. Using the Voting Cards strategy, the rest of the teams will show whether they approve,
disapprove, or are uncertain about the teams’ assignment and/or explanation. Lead a class
discussion whenever there is disapproval or uncertainty. Repeat for each plot. The correlation
coefficients for each plot are:

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot G: r = -1.00***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot H: r = 0.72***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot I: r = -0.19***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot J: r = -0.48***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot K: r = 0.98***</span>

    • <span style="color:grey">***Plot L: r = 0.00***</span>

9. Journal Entry: What is a correlation coefficient, what does it do, and what does it tell us about a
scatterplot?

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework & Next Day**</p>
Students will complete journal entry for homework if not completed in class.
