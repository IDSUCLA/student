##***<u>Lesson 3: Evaluating and Implementing a Water Campaign</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will complete the design of their water usage Participatory Sensing campaign, create the
campaign using the campaign authoring tool, and implement a mock campaign to evaluate the feasibility
of the campaign.

###**Materials:**
1. *Water Campaign* ([LMR_4.2_Water Campaign](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.2_Water Campaign.pdf)) from previous lesson

2. Posters from previous lesson

3. Markers

4. *Campaign Authoring Instructions* handout ([LMR_4.3_Campaign Authoring](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.3_Campaign Authoring.pdf))

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Statistical questions guide a participatory sensing campaign so that we can learn about a
    community or ourselves. These campaigns should be evaluated before implementing to make sure they are
    reasonable and ethically sound.

###**Lesson:**
1. Student teams will continue designing their water usage Participatory Sensing campaign. Allow
them a couple of minutes to review the information on their posters before moving on to round 4.

2. <u>Round 4:</u> Now that the teams have decided on a trigger and the type of data needed, they will
discuss and create survey questions/prompts to ask when the trigger is set. The questions should
consider all of the possible data they might collect at this trigger event.

3. Once teams have created their survey questions/prompts, they will evaluate each survey
question. For each question they should consider:

    100. What type of survey question/prompt will this be (e.g. single choice, text, photo,
    numerical, discrete numerical, categorical, location)?

    100. How does this question/prompt help address the research question?

    100. Does the question/prompt need to be reworded? (Is it clear what is being asked for? Do
    they know how to answer it?) One way to do this is to pair teams and take turns asking
    each other prompts. The team that is being asked may explain what information they
    think the question is asking for.

4. If survey questions need to be rewritten, students will decide as a team on the changes.

5. Once finalized, they will record the survey question/prompt that goes along with each data
variable on their *Water Campaign* handout ([LMR_4.2](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.2_Water Campaign.pdf)), being cognizant of question bias.

6. <u>Round 5:</u> In teams, students will now generate three statistical questions that they might answer
with the data they will collect and to guide their campaign. They need to make sure that their
statistical questions are interesting and relevant to the water usage topic. They will record these
statistical questions on their posters. Remind students that they will also have data about the date,
time, and place of data collection.

7. Confirm that the questions are statistical and that they can be answered with the data the
students propose to collect by circulating around the room to check on each team. Each team will
decide on no more than 3 statistical questions to guide their campaign.

8. Now that they have all the pieces of the campaign, teams will evaluate whether their campaign is
reasonable and ethically sound. Each team will hold a discussion on the following questions:

    100. Are answers to your survey questions likely to *vary* when the trigger occurs? (If not, you'll
    get bored entering the same data again and again)

    100. Can the team carry out the campaign?

    100. Do triggers occur so rarely that you'll have very little data? Do they occur so often that
    you'll get frustrated entering too much data?

    100. Ethics: Would sharing these data with strangers or friends be embarrassing or undermine
    someone's privacy?

    100. Can you change your trigger or survey questions to improve your evaluation?

    100. Will you be able to gather enough relevant data from your survey questions to be able to
    answer your statistical questions?

9. Students have collaboratively created their Water Usage Participatory Sensing campaign. They
will now use the Campaign Authoring tool to create a campaign like the ones they see on their
smart devices or the computer.

10. Distribute the *Campaign Authoring Instructions* handout ([LMR_4.3](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.3_Campaign Authoring.pdf)). Each team will select a
member to type the information required to create their campaign. Then, they will follow the
instructions on the handout.

11. To name their campaign, a naming convention is suggested. Otherwise, you will have multiple
campaigns with the same name. For example, teams may include their team name or number in
order to easily identify their campaigns.

12. Once their campaign is authored, students will save their work and make edits after they mock
implement the campaign for a few days.

13. They will collect data during the mock implementation of their campaign using the information
they recorded on the *Water Campaign* handout ([LMR_4.2](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 4_v_5.0/LMR_4.2_Water Campaign.pdf)) and record the answers to the
survey/prompts on paper. They will make observations about how well their campaign worked
and what improvements or changes need to be made.

14. Round 6 will be completed once students have mock-implemented their campaigns.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
