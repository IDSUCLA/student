##***<u>Lesson 3: Median in the Middle</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn that the median is another way to measure the center, or typical-ness, of a distribution,
and will understand how medians compare and contrast with the mean.


###**Vocabulary:**
median

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Another measure of center is the median, which can also be used to represent the typical value of a distribution. The median is preferred for skewed distributions or when there are outliers
    because it better matches what we think of as 'typical.'

###**Lesson:**
1. During the previous lesson, you  learned about the mean as the balancing
point of a distribution and as a measure of center. In statistics, there are a few values that can be
considered as measures of center – the mean is one, and another is the **median**. The median is
the middle value in a group of ordered observations.

2. Consider the following numbers below:

    8, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 5

3. Since there are 9 numbers in the list above, you should be using the 5<sup>th</sup> number as the median
because it is directly in the middle and there are 4 numbers above it, and 4 numbers below it.

4. However, you cannot simply pick the middle number of the list as it
is currently written (this would give a median value of 7). Instead, you must first arrange the
numbers in numerical order (from lowest to highest).

    2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

5. Now you can identify that the true median value of this list of numbers is 5.

6. Consider this scenario: 

A class of 28 students were randomly given sticky notes with numbers 0 on all of them but one, which is 1,000,000. 

7. Below is a visualization (dot plot)created by a class by placing the sticky
notes at the corresponding values on the x-axis. write your answers to the following questions in your DS Journal:

<strong style="color: blue;"> Insert chart/picture here</strong>


    100. <strong style="color: red;">What is the typical value of these data? </strong>
    
    101. <strong style="color: red;"> Using the formula we learned in class, what's the mean, or average, value of this distribution. </strong>
    
    102. <strong style="color: red;"> Does the mean you calculated match your understanding of “typical?</strong>
    
    103. <strong style="color: red;"> Why is the mean not capturing our notion of “typical?” </strong>
  

8. Since you were introduced to the idea of the median as a measure of center at the beginning of class, what do you think will be the median value for this data set?

9. In your DS Journal, write the answers to the following questions:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Why is there such a large difference between the mean and median values even though they are both measures of center? </strong>

    101. <strong style="color: red;">Is there a specific reason why the mean is larger than the median for this particular set of data? </strong>

10. Download your material for the next activity *Medians – Dotplots or Histograms*? file ([LMR_2.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.4_Medians - Dotplots or Histograms.pdf)). Both the dotplot and histogram depict
the number of candies eaten by a group of 17 high school students.

11. <strong style="color: red;">For the first 2 plots, write your answers to the following questions in your DS Journal:</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Which plot makes it easier to find the median number of candies eaten – the dot plot or the histogram? Why? </strong>

    101. <strong style="color: red;">What is the median number of candies eaten? </strong>

12. You will practice finding medians of distributions using the *Where is the
Middle?* handout ([LMR_2.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf)). You will be determining medians when distributions have different
shapes (e.g., symmetric, left-skewed, right-skewed).

13. Download the *Where is the Middle?* handout ([LMR_2.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf)). Follow the instructions in your handout and complete it.

14. In your DS journal, answer the following questions:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the
    symmetric distributions? </strong>

    101. <strong style="color: red;">What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the
    left-skewed distributions? </strong>

    102. <strong style="color: red;">What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the
    right-skewed distributions? </strong>

15. Continue referring back to the activity sheet that you just answered, focus on the  relationship between the shape of a distribution and its
corresponding mean and median values.

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Is there a pattern that emerges between the mean and median values for differently
    shaped distributions? </strong>

    101. <strong style="color: red;">For each of the plots in the *Where is the Middle?* handout ([LMR_2.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf)), which value better
    matches your idea of “typical” for that specific distribution? </strong>

16. <strong style="color: red;"> What patterns can we recognize to be the better measures of center for skewed
distributions, and for symmetric distributions?</strong>

17. Consider the last 2 plots in the *Medians – Dotplots or Histograms* file ([LMR_2.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.4_Medians - Dotplots or Histograms.pdf)).  Both the dot plot and histogram depict the number of
candies eaten by a group of 330 high school students.

18. <strong style="color: red;">Answer the following questions in your DS journal:</strong>
    
    100. <strong style="color: red;">Which plot makes it easier to find the median number of candies eaten – the dot plot or the histogram? Justify your answer.</strong>
    
    101. <strong style="color: red;">What is the median value? </strong>
    


###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
<strong style="color: red;">Do a quick write in your DS journal about what you think are the 3 most important topics you learned on this lesson.

Calculate the median values for each of the personality color scores. 


Compare the median values to the mean values (calculated in [Lesson 2](lesson2.md)) and make a decision about
the possible shape of the distribution if we were to create a dot plot of the scores. Justify your answer.</strong>
