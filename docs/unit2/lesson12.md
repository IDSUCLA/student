##***<u>Lesson 12: Don’t Take My Stress Away!</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will read the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away* to spark an interest
about how you spend your time, and will continue to read reports critically to look for claims that may or
may not be based on data.


###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    Generating statistical questions is the first step in a Participatory Sensing campaign.
    Research and observations help create applicable campaign questions.

###**Lesson:**
1. Become familiar with the *Stress/Chill Campaign Guidelines* (shown at the end of this lesson),
particularly the questions, to help guide you during the campaign (see [Campaign Guidelines](campaign1.md)
in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).

2. Answer the following questions in your DS Journal and be prepared to  share your responses in class.

    100. <strong style="color:red;"> Do you know anyone who seems to be always stressed or anyone who seems to be
    always chilled?</strong> 

    100. <strong style="color:red;"> What are some observations you have made that make that person extremely stressed
    or chilled? </strong>

3. You will be learning about some high school students who view stress as a
part of life in the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away*.

4. Read the article in the link:
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html")

5. As you read the article, <strong style="color:red;">note whether you agree or disagree with the authors
and  write down your comments and/or reactions to the article in DS journals.</strong>

6. Your teacher will provide you with an opportunity to discuss if you agree or disagree with the authors of the article and why.

7. In this unit, we will be investigating how stressed or chilled you are at
certain times of the day.

8. You will collect data using the *Stress/Chill* Participatory Sensing campaign. You will add the
*Stress/Chill* campaign to your list of available campaigns either through the UCLA [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md)
or via web browser at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")

9. You will now complete your first survey.

10. After you have completed your first survey, use a random number generator to generate two
random times a day for the next 6 days (RStudio example given below). It is recomended to choose times that are spread throughout the day.

    Example for RStudio (assuming you are awake between the hours of 7:00 am and
    11:00 pm):

    **> sample(7:23, size = 2, replace = FALSE)**

    **<u>Note:</u>** If a time falls within the school day, it is up to you to use this time
    or not.

11.  It is helpful to set reminders on the [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) for the next 6
days. If you are without a mobile device, you may set reminders using a method available to you.

12. Focus on the *Stress/Chill* survey questions and <strong style="color:red;">write down  three statistical questions that
could be answered using the *Stress/Chill* data in your DS Journal. </strong>

13. <strong style="color:red;">Write down in your DS journals some predictions about what you think you will
see after you collect some data. </strong>
