##***<u>Lesson 12: Don’t Take My Stress Away!</u>***

###**Objective**
You will read the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away* to get you thinking about how you spend your time. Then you will read some other reports critically to look for claims that may or may not be based on data.


###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 12 Essential Concepts" 
    Generating statistical questions is the first step in a Participatory Sensing campaign. Research and observations help create applicable campaign questions.

###**Lesson**
1. Become familiar with the *Stress/Chill [Campaign Guidelines](campaign1.md)*  particularly the questions, to help guide you during the campaign.

2. Answer the following questions in your IDS Journal and be prepared to share your responses in class.

    100. <strong style="color:red;"> Do you know anyone who seems to always be stressed or anyone who seems to always be chilled?</strong> 

    100. <strong style="color:red;"> What are some observations you have made that make that person extremely stressed or chilled? </strong>

3. In the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away*, you will learn about some high school students who view stress as a part of life. 

4. Read the article in the link:
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html")

5. As you read the article, note whether you agree or disagree with the authors.

6. After reading the article, write down in your IDS Journal your comments and/or reactions to what you read. If you agreed or disagreed with anything in the article, explain why.

7. In this unit we will be investigating how stressed or chilled you are at certain times of the day. You will collect data using the *Stress/Chill* Participatory Sensing campaign. 

8. First, add the *Stress/Chill* campaign to your list of available campaigns either through the [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) or via web browser at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")

9. Read the *Stress/Chill [Campaign Guidelines](campaign1.md)* to get a sense of the the campaign and to see the kinds of questions you will be answering. Then, complete your first *Stress/Chill* survey.

10. After you have completed your first survey, you will use RStudio to generate two random times a day to complete a survey over the next 6 days. It is recommended that times are spread out during the day. Using RStudio, generate two random times in which you will complete the survey each day. The RStudio code below assumes you are awake between the hours of 7:00 in the morning and 23:00 (11:00) at night. 


    **> sample(7:23, size = 2, replace = FALSE)**

    **Note:** We need to use a 24-hour clock to know the difference between time in the morning and time at night. 9 is 9 in the morning, while 21:00 is 9 at night. If a time falls within the school day, it is up to you to use this time or not.

11.  It is helpful to set reminders on the [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) for the next 6
days. If you are without a mobile device, you may set reminders using a method available to you.

12. Go back to the *Stress/Chill [Campaign Guidelines](campaign1.md)* and review the survey questions. Then record the following in your IDS Journal:

    100. <strong style="color:red;">Write three statistical questions that could be answered using the *Stress/Chill* data.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color:red;">Record at least two predictions about what you think you will see after you collect some data. </strong>

For the next 6 days you will collect data for the *Stress/Chill* campaign either through the [IDS UCLA](../download/app.md) App or via web browser at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")
