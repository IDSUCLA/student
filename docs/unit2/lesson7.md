##***<u>Lesson 7: Plot Match</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn how to create a boxplot from an already-established dotplot.

###**Vocabulary:**
representation

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Boxplots are an alternative visualization of histograms or dotplots. They capture
    most, but not all, of the features we can see in a dotplot or histogram.

###**Lesson:**
1. Answer the following question in your IDS journal:<strong style="color: red;"> What are the components of the five-number
summary that make up a boxplot?</strong> Refer to lesson 5 if you need to review boxplots.

2. <strong style="color: red;">State what each component means in a boxplot</strong>.

3. Recall that during [Lesson 5](lesson5.md), you created a boxplot from students’ heights.

4. A boxplot is one **representation** of the distribution of a variable in a data set. You
have worked with other representations of distributions.
    
    These are other representations of distributions you have seen:
    dotplots, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and tables.
    
  Review the following characteristics of some of those representations.
  
  Histograms are useful for almost any type of data. They can easily show the shape of a distribution (including
    skewness and multiple peaks). They are usually best with larger data sets.
    
  Dotplots can also easily show the shape of a distribution. They are preferred over histograms when there is a
    relatively small amount of data.
    
  Boxplots are useful when the distribution has one mode (one peak). They are also useful to describe data that
    are heavily skewed or that contain outliers.
    
  Dotplots and histograms can show the number of modes in a distribution, but a boxplot cannot. If a distribution is bimodal, we will
    not be able to tell in a boxplot. In general, we lose the ability to talk about the overall shape of the distribution.
  
    
5. You will use the *From Dotplots to Boxplots* handout ([LMR_2.11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.11_Dotplots to Boxplots.pdf)). You will sketch boxplots from dotplots. Remember that each dot represents an observation. You will need to determine the five-number summaries of each plot, and should clearly label each value on your boxplots.

6. Be sure to answer the questions included in the handout after you sketch the two boxplots. 

7. In the next activity, you will attempt to find plots that represent the same data but are plotted differently.

8. You will receive one set of plots, from the *Plot Match* file ([LMR_2.12](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.12_Plot Match.pdf))


<strong style="color: blue;">Create a document where the plots can be rearranged?</strong>

9. You will practice matching different representations of distributions. You will work with 15 plots (5 dotPlots, 5 histograms, and 5 boxplots). Your task is to create 5 sets of 3 plots. Each set will contain a dotplot, a histogram, and a boxplot that represent the same data. 

10. Once you have decided upon your five groupings, record your responses to the following
statements and/or questions in your DS journals:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What types of data are best for using a histogram?</strong> 
    
    100. <strong style="color: red;">What types of data are best for using a dotplot?</strong> 
    
    100. <strong style="color: red;">What types of data are best for using a boxplot?</strong> 
    
    100. <strong style="color: red;">Describe some characteristics of data that become hidden when a boxplot is used
    instead of a dotplot or histogram.</strong> 

11. Check your work from step nine. Below are the letters that correspond to each set of representations.

    <span style="color:grey">***Solution key:***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 1: Plots (d), (a), (b)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 2: Plots (m), (c), (h)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 3: Plots (f), (j), (o)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 4: Plots (e), (l), (i)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Set 5: Plots (n, (k), (g)***</span>

12. Think about some pros and cons of using different types of graphical representations to display the same data.
