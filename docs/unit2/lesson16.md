##***<u>Lesson 16: What is Normal?</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn what a Normal distribution is and how to identify a Normal distribution.


###**Vocabulary:**
bell-shaped, normal curve, normal distribution

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    The Normal curve, also called the Gaussian distribution and the "bell curve," is a
    model that describes many real-life distributions and is usually called the Normal Model.

###**Lesson:**
1. Recall that in [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md), [Lesson 11](../unit1/lesson11.md) (*What Shape Are You In?*), you sorted histograms into groups based on their shapes.

2. The *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_2.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.15_Normal Plots.pdf)) contains some of the unimodal **bell-shaped** distributions from the original handout of that lesson (*Sorting* Histograms handout ([LMR_1.10](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.10_Sorting Histograms.pdf))).
Six plots are included: SAT Math, SAT Verb, ACT Mathematics, ACT Reading, ACT English, and ACT Science Reasoning.

3. Observe the group of bell-shaped distributions from the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_2.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.15_Normal Plots.pdf)) and answer the following questions in your DS Journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What characteristic does this particular group share?</strong>

    100. These types of distributions are often referred to as bell-shaped. <strong style="color: red;">Why
    might this term be used?</strong>
    
4. Notice the similarities between the shape of a bell and the shape of these distributions, <strong style="color: blue;"> insert bell clip-art
image included in the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_2.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.15_Normal Plots.pdf)) on page 2.</strong>


5. This shape occurs often in real-life. It occurs so often that it’s been given its own
name: the **normal curve**, or **normal distribution**. Can you think of distributions where
you have seen Normal curves in previous labs?

6. Watch the first 41 seconds of the New York Times video titled “Bunnies, Dragons, and the Normal World” by clicking the link below. This video will give you some more background on the normal distribution.
[http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html](http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html "http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002452709/bunnies-dragons-and-the-normal-world.html")

7. The normal curve has a very precise mathematical definition, which is pretty complex.
But the result is a curve that looks like the one in the “Bunnies” video. In general, the curve looks
like the plot shown below.

<strong style="color: blue;">  display the normal curve image found on page 2 of the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_2.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.15_Normal Plots.pdf)).</strong>
    

8. Normal distributions are good for describing some populations of people. For
example, people’s heights are often considered to be normally distributed. Observe the famous
Frank Anscombe photograph (shown below). This photo was taken of a group of randomly selected college women who stood in height order. 
<strong style="color: blue;">  Insert Anscombe's photo found on page 2 of the *Normal Plots* file ([LMR_2.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.15_Normal Plots.pdf)).</strong>


9. Why do you think the normal curve is a good fit to the histogram in the above
picture. Notice that more people are near the center of the distribution, and fewer are in the outer
edges, or tails. Answer the following questions in your DS journal:

    100. Notice that there is a peak in the center of the distribution. <strong style="color: red;">What height do you think is at
    the center? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Why are more people in the center, and less people in the edges, or tails, of the
    distribution? </strong>

10. The normal curve is a good description of a distribution when it makes sense that
there is a single 'typical' value with random deviations above and below that value. Answer the following in your DS journals:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Why does this make sense with heights but not with incomes?</strong> 
    
    100. <strong style="color: red;">Are there more real-life examples, other than height, that you think might follow a
    normal distribution? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Does it matter that the curve drawn on the photograph does not match exactly to the
    women’s heights? </strong>

11. During the next few lessons, you will be learning more about the normal
distribution. In particular, you will learn about a new measure of spread used to describe a
normal distribution, how to calculate probabilities from this distribution, and how to randomly
sample from this distribution.

12. *Cheat Card:* Use an index card or a 3 x 5 piece of paper to create a cheat card that will
help you remember information about the normal curve.
