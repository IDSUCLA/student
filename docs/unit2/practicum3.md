##**<u>Practicum: What Stresses Us?</u>**

###**Objective**
You will use RStudio to make graphical representations or numerical summaries of your *Stress/Chill* and *Personality Color* data to answer research questions.

###**Instructions**
1. Using what you learned in [*Lab 2G, Getting It Together*](lab2g.md), you will complete the task outlined in the *Unit 2,Practicum 3: What Stresses Us?* handout.

You made a data set that combines your *Stress/Chill* data with your *Personality Color* data. You will use this
data to answer the following research questions:

* Do color personalities really predict a personâ€™s personality?

* Do people with different personality colors tend to have different stress levels?

###**Task**

Based on the merged data, you need to:

1. Write a one-page report to address these research questions. Use the Data Cycle. Your analysis should include both numerical methods (means, medians, etc.) and graphical methods (plots). The research questions are fairly broad, so you should first think of simpler statistical questions you could ask that would address these research questions.

2. In your report, be sure to:

    a. Provide the plot(s) and numerical summary (or summaries).

    b. Describe what the plot shows.

    c. Explain why you chose to make a particular plot.
    
    d. Explain how the plot and numerical summary answers your statistical question.

3. Present your report to another member of the class who is not on your team. Make sure to include any relevant plots or numerical summaries that you use.

**Note:** You may use the scoring guide in [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md) to give you an idea of how to score the Practicum.
