##***<u>Lesson 1: What is Your True Color?</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will collect data that might tell you about your personality type, and you will understand how to subset data.

###**Vocabulary:**
subsets

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    The 'typical' value is a value that can represent the
    entire group, even though not all members of the group share the same value.

###**Lesson:**
1. Consider the following questions:

    100. How well do you know yourself?

    100. How well do you know your classmates?

2. There are things people know and don’t know about themselves. The *True Colors Personality
Test* ([LMR_2.1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.1_True Colors Personality Test.pdf)) claims to identify personality types. You will use a group of students' personality data to explore fundamental statistical concepts.

3. Take the *True Colors Personality Test*. In this personality test you will see 4 sets of words in each row. Get a general sense of the words and rank each group using the numbers one through four. Four should be given to the group of words that describes you the most, three to the next group and so on until each one of the four boxes has a number. Do the same for the rest of the rows. Caution: do not add the scores by column, instead add the score of the letters listed in each box at the bottom of the test. Be sure to read the information on the first page and the instructions on the second page very carefully. ([LMR_2.1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.1_True Colors Personality Test.pdf)).  
<strong style="color: blue;"> remove the final page, which contains the descriptions of each color.</strong>

4. You should have a score for each of the 4 colors. <strong style="color: red;">Record each color and its
respective score in your DS journal.</strong> The color with the highest score describes
your personality. We can refer to this as your predominant color. <strong style="color: red;">Record your
predominant personality color in your DS journal as well.</strong> You will see
what each color means at the end of the lesson.

5. A group of students took the personality test and was asked to gather in a different corner of the classroom by their personality color. Which group would you join based on your personality color?<strong style="color: blue;"> graphic of the personality colors on each corner and made up student names.</strong>.

6. Observe the data provided about that group of students. Record answers to the following questions in your DS journals. 
 
    100. <strong style="color: red;">How many students are in your color group?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">How many students are in each of the other color groups?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What is the predominant personality color in that class?
</strong>

7. You will observe the characteristics of four groups of students. These students were grouped by their predominat personality color. Start with the group of people with your predominant color. Determine some common characteristics of the people in this group by answering the questions below in your DS journal. Those common characteristics help you answer “what is typical?” within this group. Keep in mind that a characteristic might be considered "typical" even though it is not shared by every single member of the group. <strong style="color: blue;"> Insert characteristics for people in each personality color group </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What are their likes and dislikes?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What things do they have in common?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What are their favorite activities?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What’s their favorite color?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Do they prefer mornings or nights?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What’s their favorite type of music?</strong>
    
8. Observe the characteristics of the other three personality colors and determine some traits that are typical to each group. You will be able to compare perceived traits with the actual descriptions from the activity at the end of the class.

9. The students were then asked to gather into two **subsets**: male and female. This is called subsetting. This is another way to organize collected data.
  
10. Copy and finish the two-way frequency table below to record the results from the data set.
<strong style="color: blue;">Insert two-way frequency table with the first column filled out </strong>

11. A useful way of anaylizing data is to create visuals by comparing subsets. The students were asked to create visualizations that subset the variables. Observe their first visualization in which they subset the orange variable by gender.
<strong style="color: blue;">Insert visualization that subsets the orange variable by gender</strong> 
Copy and finish the following sentence in your DS journal.
<strong style="color: red;">The typical gender in the Orange personality color group is ______________. </strong>
In your DS journal, create a visualization that subsets gender by color and write a sentence comparing the two variables you used.

12. If you are confused or stuck, recall the topic of two-way tables and relative
frequencies from [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md) ([Lessons 16](../unit1/lesson16.md) & [17](../unit1/lesson17.md)). Notice that the students looked at the
columns and compared genders. You need to look at the rows and compare colors to create your visual.

13. The students came up with two additional visuals.<strong style="color: blue;">Insert two additional visualizations </strong>

14. Observe their similarities and differences. Analyze and interpret the visualizations by answering the following questions for each of the visualizations in your IDS journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What type of plot is this and how many variables are present? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What information about this subset can I gather from this visualization? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do I see the most/least of? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What is the typical personality color for this subset? Or, what is the typical gender for this subset? </strong>

15. Summarize your impressions of the class’s personality color data in your DS journal.

16. The document below provides the description of each personality color (page 3 of [LMR_2.1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.1_True Colors Personality Test.pdf)). Remember that the highest score is considered your predominant color and the second highest score is considered your secondary color. If there is a tie for your predominant or secondary colors, choose the color that describes your personality better.
<strong style="color: blue;">Insert page 3 of LMR_2.1 </strong>

17. Compare the given descriptions on the handout to the characteristics listed for each group during step 7. Do the descriptions match what you originally thought? How accurate are the descriptions? 

18. You will now record your own data by completing the *Personality Color* campaign on the UCLA
[IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) or via web browser at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org").
