##***<u>Lesson 5: Human Boxplots</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn how and when to use boxplots to compare groups of data. You will also learn how to
compute and interpret another measure of spread: the IQR.


###**Vocabulary:**
boxplot, quartiles, first quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>), third quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>), quantiles, minimum, maximum, five-number
summary, range, interquartile range (IQR)

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    A common statistical question is “How does this group compare to that group?”
    This is a hard question to answer when the groups have lots of variability. One approach is to compare
    the centers, spreads, and shapes of the distributions. Boxplots are a useful way of comparing
    distributions from different groups when all of the distributions are unimodal (one hump).

###**Lesson:**
1. We have been using the following numerical and graphical summaries to
look at data:

    100. Measures of center – mean, median

    100. Measures of spread – MAD

    100. Graphing – dotPlots, histograms

2. All of these tools help us describe data to someone who may not actually be viewing it. Today, we will explore another way to summarize and describe data to others with the use of
another type of statistical plot that involves breaking data up into distinct pieces: a **boxplot**.

3. For the next activity, you will need your DS journals and a pen.

4. You will have to go to your kitchen area at home and gather food containers (plastic, canned or glass bottles) of different sizes and heights. They do not have to be empty (check your refrigerator, cabinets, under the sink). Place all the food containers that you have gathered on top of the counter or table.You will need at least 19 of them.

    **<u>Note:</u>** If there isn’t enough food containers, you may use also check your laundry area.

5. After you have gathered all the food containers and by just looking as they currently stand, will you be able to tell which of them represents the typical height of food containers in your home? How would you be able to tell?” 

  100. Do a Quickwrite on your DS Journal on how you will be able to "spot" a better visual for the heights of the food containers.

6. Line the food "bottles" up in height order from shortest to tallest.

7. Once you have arranged them, how do you describe the distribution
of heights. Is there any trend that you are observing?

8. Split the your distribution into two groups, one half that is taller and one half that is shorter,
and decide which "bottle" or can represents the median height.

9.  Tape a piece of paper, vertically to a wall in your kitchen. Place the "median" container stand next to the wall directly in front of the paper. You will be creating a plot using lines drawn at certain heights.

10. Draw a horizontal line on the poster paper to mark the location of the median. Be sure to label
this point as the median and include the container's actual height, in centimeters.

11. Next, split the two halves to again, so there are now four groups of containers.

12. The breaks between each group are called **quartiles** because they break the data into four
groups (*quartile* comes from the Latin word *quartus*, which is also the root of the Spanish word
*cuatro*). The lower break represents the **first quartile** (because 25% of the class is shorter than
this student’s height), and the upper break represents the **third quartile** (because 75% of the
class is shorter than this height). Another term that can be used in place of percentiles is
**quantiles** because they represent the *quantity* of data that is lower than that value.

13. Using the container that represents the first quartile, draw another horizontal line on the 
paper marking its height. You should place the container in the same spot as the container which
represented the median so that the line for this container is drawn underneath the median line. Be
sure to label this point as the first quartile (or **Q<sub>1</sub>**) and include the container'ss actual height, in
centimeters.

14. Using the container that represents the third quartile, draw another horizontal line on the
paper marking its height. The container should stand in the same spot as the container that
represented the median so that the line for this container is drawn above the median line. Be sure
to label this point as the third quartile (or **Q<sub>3</sub>**) and include the container’s actual height, in centimeters.

15. Finally, use the tallest and shortest container to stand in front of the paper and draw
horizontal lines at their heights. The shortest container represents the **minimum** height of the
containers in your kitchen, and the tallest represents the **maximum** height. Be sure to label the
points as the minimum and maximum, and include the containers’ actual heights, in centimeters.

16. When you finish, you should have five lines, which represent the **five-number summary**:
minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. Draw a box using the first and third
quartiles as the edges of the box. The median line will be contained within the box. Extend a line
from the first quartile down to the minimum and extend a line from the third quartile up to the
maximum. Your boxplot should look similar to the following:

17. Sketch the boxplot in your DS journals, with the appropriate labels.

18. Answer the following questions in your DS Journal using the boxplot that you just created:

    <strong style="color: red;">100. Inform students that this difference is known as the **range** of the
    data set. What is the difference between the largest and smallest heights? Is there a large
    difference between the tallest and shortest container? </strong>
    
    <strong style="color: red;">101. What is the difference between the quartiles Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>3</sub>? What percent of your distribution falls
    within these two values? When you calculate Q<sub>3</sub> – Q<sub>1</sub>. 50% of the class falls
    between these two height values.This difference is known as the
    **interquartile range (or IQR)**.</strong>

19. You learned about one measure of spread (the MAD) during the previous
lesson, and you now have another measure of spread – the IQR. Do a quickwrite in your DS Journal about to answer the following questions:

  <strong style="color: red;">100. What does it mean when the IQR is small? Circle one of the underlined words </strong>
        
The middle 50% of heights are <u>close/spread-out</u> to each other.

  <strong style="color: red;">101. What does it mean when the IQR is large? Circle one of the underlined word</strong>
         
The middle 50% of heights are <u>close/spread-out</u>spread out.

20. Finally, subset the distribution into canned and plastic/glass. You will create each a boxplot of  heights on a piece of paper using the techniques you just learned in today's session.

21. In your DS Journal:

    <strong style="color: red;">100. Copy your boxplots.
    101. Write about the similarities and differences between the plots. 
    102. Compare to the overall combined boxplot of heights that you created earlier. 
    103. Calculate the IQR for both plots.
    104. What does the IQR tell us about each group?</strong>
