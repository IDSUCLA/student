Instructional Days: 8

Permutations of data provide a model that shows us how the world behaves if chance is the only reason
for differences between groups or for associations between variables. If our actual observation is a rare
permutation, this suggests that chance is not a good explanation for the difference or association. On the
other hand, if the actual observation is a common permutation, this suggests that chance may be a valid
explanation. Differences between permuted data and actual data suggest that the chance model can be
rejected and there is a dependent relationship between two variables.

You will read the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away* to set the stage for the Stress/Chill Campaign. High school students who expected to feel stressed out by school wrote this article.

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

S-IC 2: Decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, e.g.,
using simulation.

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Understand that a chance model serves as an indicator of whether or not associations in the actual data
are due to chance (understand why a plot might appear to have a trend, but may actually be the result of
randomness). Understand that simulations provide a way of comparing expected chance outcomes to
real outcomes in order to determine if a model and actual data appear consistent. Learn about merging
data sets by understanding the structure of both data sets and the logic of the way they will be combined.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking using RStudio:*</ins>

• Permutations of data, determining if actual data is similar to permuted data

• Merge multiple data sets together based on a common variable

• Create permutations using a merged data set

<ins>*Real-World Connections:*</ins>

In media, citizens read about results and scientific studies in which treatments are applied. In real life, one
can ask the question: Does this happen by chance? Understanding chance helps us interpret media
reports of scientific and medical findings.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. You will use complex sentences to construct summary statements about your understanding of data, how it is collected, how it used, and how to work with it.

2. You will engage in partner and whole group discussions and presentations to share your understanding of data science concepts.

3. You will use complex sentences to write informative short reports that use data science concepts and skills.

4. You will read informative texts to evaluate claims based on data.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Data File or Data Collection Method**</p>
<ins>*Data Collection Method:*</ins> *Stress/Chill Participatory Sensing Campaign*

1. You will monitor how you feel  – whether you are “stressing” or “chilling” - at different times of the day. 

2. You will make other observations as well, such as whether you alone or with others, what you are doing at that moment, and why you are doing that activity.

<ins>*Data Files:*</ins>

1. Your *Personality Color* survey data (*colors*)

2. Your *Stress/Chill* campaign data

3. Titanic data set (*titanic.rda*)

4. Horror Movie data set (*slasher.rda*)
