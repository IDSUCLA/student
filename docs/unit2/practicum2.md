##***<u>Practicum: Win Win Win</u>***

###**Objective**
You will create and combine simulations to assess probabilities.

###**Instructions**
1. Using what you learned in [*Lab 2C, Which Song Plays Next?*](lab2c.md) and [*Lab 2D, Queue it Up!*](lab2d.md), you will complete the task outlined in the *Unit 2, Practicum 2: Win, Win, Win* handout.

2. The *Win, Win, Win* handout outlines the rules of the California' lottery's *Daily 3* game, which you'll use to combine simulations and assess possibilities. Here's how it works:

    •  Three numbers between 0 - 9 are drawn daily.

    •  The numbers are drawn with *replacement*.

    •  Winners are usually awarded a couple of hundred dollars.

    •  To win the maximum amount of money, players must correctly choose the numbers that are drawn, in order.

###**Task**

Based on what you learned in [*Lab 2C*](lab2c.md) and [*Lab 2D*](lab2d.md), and using the rules of the *Daily 3*, you need to:

1. Write down the code to correctly simulate the *Daily 3* once.

2. Use your code to simulate the *Daily 3* 500 times.

3. Compute the estimated probability of getting the first two numbers of the *Daily 3* correct.

4. Should the estimated probability of correctly guessing the last two numbers of the *Daily 3* be less than, the same as, or more than guessing the first two numbers? Why?

5. In teams of four:

    100. Each team member chooses three numbers for the *Daily 3*.

    100. Each team member simulates the *Daily 3* game 500 times.

    100. Within your group, combine the team simulation estimates to estimate the probability of winning the *Daily 3*.
    
6. Write and submit a one-page report. Your report should include the code.
