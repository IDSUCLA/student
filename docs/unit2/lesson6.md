##***<u>Lesson 6: Face Off</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will informally compare two or more distributions using your knowledge of shape, center, and
spread to answer statistical questions. You will learn how to find the difference between two means and
two medians using a histogram or dotplot.


###**Vocabulary:**
rebuttal

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Writing (and saying) precise comparisons between groups in which variability is
    present based on the (a) center, (b) spread, (c) shape, and (d) unusual outcomes help to make
    statements in context of the data. Actual comparison statements should use terms such as "less than,"
    "about the same as," etc.

###**Lesson:**
1. What method of transportation did you use for your daily school commute before the COVID-19 lockdown. Did you walk, ride in a car, take the bus, ride a bike, etc.? Do you remember how long it took you to get to school (in minutes)?

2. You have learned important features of distributions that will allow you to
make decisions when working with data. More specifically, you will be able to use your
knowledge of measures of center and measures of spread to compare 2 distributions in order to
make a decision.

3. Complete the *Comparing Commute Times with Dotplots* handout
([LMR_2.8](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.8_Commute Times - Dotplots.pdf)). Read the “Background” portion of the handout, and then
<strong style="color: red;">in your DS Journal, write down what statistical question(s) the student in the scenario is trying to answer.</strong>

4. Once you have completed the handout, write your recommendations in your DS Journal. Imagine that you are to engage  in an *Active Debate* with your classmates.

5. <strong style="color: red;"> First, you will write in your DS Journal the benefits of street travel over freeway travel by using academic language based on the dotplot. List as many reasons as you can why you claim that street travel is better.</strong>

6. <strong style="color: red;"> Next, below your first claim, you will write (in your DS Journal) the benefits of freeway travel over street travel by using academic language based on the dotplot. List as many reasons as you can why you claim that freeway travel is better.</strong>

7. <strong style="color: red;">Give yourself time to compare and contrast the two choices and it is suggested that you may write a two-column list starting with the first column about street travel from the strongest reason or claim using academic language.</strong>

8. Complete your **rebuttal** of your first claim by writing your reasons why freeway travel is better, from the strongest reason that supports your claim using academic language.

<strong style="color: blue;"> insert an example of a  Two column Rebuttal here. Use the possible answers in the handout and remove page 2 </strong>

9. Go over the claim and rebuttal process.Make sure that you only used statistical data based on the handout and not include your own opinions.

10. Finalize your recommendations and answer the following questions in your DS Journal:<strong style="color: red;"> Did your initial choice of claim change after you made the data analysis? Why or why not? </strong>


11. You will  complete the *Comparing Exam Scores with Histograms* handout
([LMR_2.9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.9_Exam Scores - Histograms.pdf)). Read the “Background” portion of the handout, and then <strong style="color: red;">in your DS Journal, write what statistical question(s) the student in the scenario is trying to answer.</strong>
<div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0_preview/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.9_Exam Scores - Histograms.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_2.9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.9_Exam Scores - Histograms.pdf)</div>

12. Repeat "debate process"" (Steps 4 - 10).

13. Summarize the lesson by doing a Quickwrite in your DS Journal. <strong style="color: red;">What are the pieces of information that we are looking for when comparing
distributions?  You should be precise when estimating values of means, medians, MAD, and
IQR. You should also be able to comment on when it is most appropriate to use each measure
of center and spread. 

<span style="color:grey">***For example: If a distribution is symmetric, it is best to use the _______ as a measure
of center and the MAD as a measure of spread. If a distribution is ____________, or has outliers,
it is best to use the median as a measure of center and the IQR as a measure of spread.***</span>

Similar to the activities you did during class today, for homework, you will complete the
*Comparing Fuel Efficiency with Boxplots* handout ([LMR_2.10](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.10_Fuel Efficiency - Boxplots.pdf)).
