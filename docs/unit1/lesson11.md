##***<u>Lesson 11: What Shape Are You In?</u>***
 
###**Objective**
You will learn to classify distributions in terms of shape, and can suggest theories for why a
distribution might be one shape or another.

###**Vocabulary**

symmetric, left-skewed, right-skewed, unimodal, bimodal

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Identifying the shape of a histogram is part of the **interpret** step of the Data Cycle.

###**Lesson**

1. For this lesson you will be sorting histograms.

2. In a histogram, the type of data being measured is indicated on the horizontal axis, and the
vertical axis represents how many observations are in each bar.

3. You will sort the histograms into different groups according to their shapes.
Histograms that have similar shapes should be placed together in one of the six boxes. The activity has been formatted such that you can place the histograms directly on top of each other to verify if their shapes are similar.

    **Note:** Open the document below using google slides and make a copy onto your google drive. Find View on the menu option, go to zoom and choose 50% to be able to view the 18 histograms that need to be sorted.

4. Once you have sorted the histograms into groups, answer the following questions in your DS journals:

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Describe whatâ€™s similar about the plots in each group.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Pick one graph in each group that is the best example of that group. </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Give the group a name that you think describes the general shape. </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> If there are graphs that do not fit into any group, try to determine why it was impossible to
    place them. What is different or confusing about them?</strong>

5. After writing down your observations, think about how your classmates may have done their histogram groupings. Do you think their groupings and general shapes would be similar to yours?

6. In statistics, we use specific terminology when discussing the shapes of distributions, such as
**symmetric**, **right-skewed**, **left-skewed**, **unimodal**, **bimodal**, etc. A symmetric distribution looks like a bell with a peak at the center and the **tails** on each side nearly identical. A right-skewed distribution has a peak near the left and a *tail* on the right. A left-skewed distribution has a peak near the right and a *tail* on the left. A unimodal distribution has only one peak, also known as a "mode". A bimodal distribution has two peaks. 

    **<u>Note:</u>** Another type of distribution is a Uniform Distribution which has no peak and looks almost like a rectangle.

    <strong style="color: red;"> Did you use any of these terms? If not, indentify which of your histograms could be classified as
    each shape. </strong>

7. <strong style="color: red;">Read the following scenarios and try to determine what a corresponding
histogram might look like. You should use statistical terms to describe your answer and provide a justification.</strong>

    Let's try one together:

    The grades on an easy test. 

    <span style="color:grey">***The distribution of grades on an easy test would be left-skewed and unimodal. Since the test was easy, a lot of students will score high, so most scores will be in the 80s and 90s with a single peak around 90. There will only be a few students that had low scores like 60s and 70s, so there will be a tail on the left.***</span>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">The grades on a difficult test.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">The number of times IDS students study during the first week of class.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">The age of cars on a used car lot.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">The amount of time spent by students on a difficult test (max time allowed is 50 mins).</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">The heights of students in your high school band.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">The salaries of all persons employed at a school district.</strong>
