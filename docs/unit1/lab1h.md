##***<u>Lab 1H - Our time.</u>***
Directions: Follow along with the slides and answer the questions in **bold** font in your journal.

###**We've come a long way**

* The labs until now have covered a huge range of topics:

    – We've learned how to make plots for different types of variables.

    – We know how to subset our data to get a more refined view of our data.

    – We've covered cleaning data and making two-way frequency tables.

* In this lab, we're going to combine all of these ideas and topics together to find out how we
spend out time.

###**First steps first.**

* *Export*, *Upload*, *Import* the class' ```timeuse``` data from the <u>IDS Homepage</u> as ```timeuse_raw```.

* The data, as-is, is very messy and hard to interpret/analyze.

    – Fill in the blank with the name of your imported data to format it:

        timeuse <- timeuse_format( ______ )

* This function formats/cleans the data so that each row represents a typical day for each
student in the class

###**timeuse_format specifics**

* In case you're wondering, the timeuse_format function:

    – Takes each student's daily data and adds up all of the time spent doing each
    activity for each day.

    – The time spent on each activity for each day is then average together to create a
    *typical* day in the life of each student.

###**Exploring your data**

* Start by getting familiar with your ```timeuse``` data:

    – **How many observations and variables are there?**

    – **What are the names of the variables?**

    – **Which row represents YOUR *typical* day?**

###**How do we spend our time?**

* We would like to investigate the *research question*: "How did our class spend our time?"

    – To do this, we'll perform a statistical investigation.

* **State and answer two statistical questions based on our *research question*.**

    – **Also, state one way in which your personal data is typical and one way that it
    *differs* from the rest of the class.**

* **Justify your answers by using appropriate statistical graphics and summary tables.**

    – **If you subset your data, explain why and how it benefited your analysis.**
