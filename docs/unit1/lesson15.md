##***<u>Lesson 15: Americans’ Time on Task</u>***

###**Objective**
Introduction to *Time Use Campaign*. You will explore The New York Times multimedia graphic titled
*How Different Groups Spend Their Time* to spark your interest about how you spend your time. You will
begin to learn how to evaluate reports that make claims based on data by reading *The Washington Post*
article *Teens Are Spending More Time Consuming Social Media*, *On Mobile Devices*.


###**Vocabulary**
evaluate, claim

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Learning to examine other analyses is an important part of statistical thinking.
    
###**Lesson**
1. Take a look at the *Time-Use Campaign Guidelines* (found through the link after this lesson),
particularly the big questions, to get familiar with the next campaign.

2. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some predictions you might make based on the big questions in the *Time-Use Campaign
Guidelines*? </strong>

3. In this lesson you will be exploring time use through an interactive graphic based off of data from *The Bureau of Labor Statistics* (BLS) which collects data about Americans’
daily time use.

4. Go to the multimedia graphic at the following URL:<br>
    [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0 "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0")

5. Spend some time exploring the interactive graphic. <strong style="color: red;"> Then answer the
following questions: </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What variables are represented in this graphic? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Explain what the graphic is telling you. </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Where did the data come from? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some interesting findings? Be prepared to share. </strong>

6. Check your understanding of the above questions:
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The variables represented are activities that Americans spend their time doing. These include sleeping, eating, traveling, socializing, etc.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some examples might be: The graphic shows how much time Americans over the age of 15 are spending doing these activities. This information is broken down by different categories of Americans (e.g., gender, ethnicity) and the percentage of Americans doing a particular activity at a particular time (e.g., 5% of Americans are working at 6:00 am). The average time spent on a particular activity is also shown (e.g., average time spent at work for all Americans is 3 hours and 25 minutes)***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The data came from thousands of Americans over the age of 15 who took a survey recalling every minute of a day in 2008***</span>
    100. Share your findings with your teacher/classmates.

7. You will continue to investigate Americans’ daily time use and use the [KLW
graphic organizer] as a way to organize your thoughts (../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_K-L-W Chart.pdf). Before you read the *The Washington Post* article: *Teens Are Spending
More Time Consuming Social Media*, *On Mobile Devices*, <strong style="color: red;">write what you already know
about the topic in the *Know* column. </strong>

    **<u>Note:</u>** If this is your first time using KLW, the K column is where you write what you already KNOW, the L column is where you write what you LEARNED, and the W column is where you write what you WANT TO LEARN (or wonderings that you might have).

8. Next, read the article:<br>
    [https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html "https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html")

9. <strong style="color: red;"> As you read, you may complete the Learn column of the [KLW graphic organizer](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_K-L-W Chart.pdf). </strong>

10. <strong style="color: red;"> After you have finished reading the article, complete the Want to Learn column. </strong>

11. When reading a newspaper, magazine, or blog that includes statistical analysis, it is important to
**evaluate**, or think carefully, about **claims** that these articles state as fact.

12. Now that you have identified what you Know, Learned, and Want to Learn about this article, evaluate the article based on the questions below:

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Who was observed and what were the variables observed? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What statistical questions were they trying to answer? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Who collected the data? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> How was the data collected? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What claim(s) did the article make? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some statistics that the article used to make the claim(s)? </strong>
    
13. Check your understanding of the above questions:
    100. <span style="color:grey">***A group of 8 to 18-year-olds were observed, and the variables observed had to do with consuming media - watching TV, listening to music, surfing the Web, playing video games, and the time spent on mobile devices***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***A possible statistical question is "How much time per day does today's typical 8 to 18-year-old spend consuming media?" but you may have to share your statistical questions with your teacher/classmates***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***There were 3 sources cited. The Kaiser Family Foundation collected a 2010 study, the Pew Internet and American Life Project collected data in a 2011 study, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics collected data in 2011 with the American Time Use Survey***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Two were studies whose data collection method is not stated, and one is a survey***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Main claim: "Today's teens spend more than 7.5 hours a day consuming media"***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some examples are "Teens use their cellphones to send an average of 60 texts a day", "On average, high school students spent less than one hour per weekday on sports, exercise, and recreation", but you may have to share your identified statistics with your teacher/classmates.***</span>

14. You will engage in the Time-Use Participatory Sensing campaign and will
begin to collect data about your own time use. Follow the *Time-Use Guidelines*.

    **<u>Reminder:</u>** Once logged into the app or the browser-based version, you may go to
    **Campaigns** to see the campaigns in which you are participating. You can then add the
    campaign by tapping the name of the campaign. If no campaigns are visible, ask them to click the
    refresh option.

15. Just as in the NY Times interactive graphic, you will be observing and recording your daily time use. You should fill out the Time Use Data Collection Template each morning to organize your time use data before submitting it to the Time Use Campaign. It is split into 4 sections in order to calculate your overall daily time use more easily: <strong style="color: blue;"> insert time use data collection template here and maybe an example video/image of how to fill it out? </strong>

    100. 6am-3pm (which should total 540 minutes)

    100. 3pm-9pm (which should total 360 minutes)

    100. 9pm-6am (which should total 540 minutes)

    100. TOTALS (add across each activity row to get the total time spent doing that activity - the final total for each entire day should add to 1440 minutes)
