##***<u>Lesson 15: Americans’ Time on Task</u>***

###**Objective**
Introduction to Time Use Campaign. You will explore multimedia graphics that incorporate data from the American Time Use Survey to spark your interest about how you spend their time. You will begin to learn how to evaluate reports that make claims based on data by reading The Washington Post article Teens Are Spending More Time Consuming Social Media, On Mobile Devices.


###**Vocabulary**
evaluate, claim

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 15 Essential Concepts"
    Learning to examine other analyses is an important part of statistical thinking.
    
###**Lesson**
1. Click on [Campaign Guidelines - Time Use](campaign2.md) (the link can also be found on the left side of this page) and take a look at the guidelines - particularly the big questions - to get familiar with the next campaign. 

2. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some predictions you might make based on the big questions in the *Time Use* campaign
guidelines? </strong>

3. In this lesson you will be exploring time use through an interactive graphic based on data from The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which collects data about Americans’ and time use through an interactive graph. 

4. Go to the multimedia graphic at the following URL:<br>
    <ul><a href= "https://flowingdata.com/2015/11/10/counting-the-hours/">Counting the hours</a></ul><ul><a href="https://flowingdata.com/2016/12/06/how-people-like-you-spend-their-time/">How people like you spend their time</a></ul><ul><a href ="https://flowingdata.com/2015/11/30/most-common-use-of-time-by-age-and-sex/">Most common use of time by age and sex</a></ul><ul><a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/">A day in the life of americans</a></ul>
    
5. Spend some time exploring the interactive graphic. Try clicking on the activities represented by different colors, and on the boxes to filter by group (Everyone, men, women, etc.), then answer the following questions:


    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What variables are represented in this graphic? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Explain what the graphic is telling you. </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Where did the data come from? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some interesting findings?</strong>

6. Check your understanding of the above questions. Here are some possible responses:
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The variables represented are activities that Americans spend their time doing. These include sleeping, eating, traveling, socializing, etc.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some examples might be: The graphic shows how much time Americans over the age of 15 are spending doing these activities. This information is broken down by different categories of Americans (e.g., gender, ethnicity), and the percentage of Americans doing a particular activity at a particular time (e.g., 5% of Americans are working at 6:00 am). The average time spent on a particular activity is also shown (e.g., average time spent at work for all Americans is 3 hours and 25 minutes).***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The data came from thousands of Americans over the age of 15 who took a survey recalling every minute of a day in 2008.***</span>

7. You will continue to investigate Americans’ daily time use and use the KLW graphic organizer as a way to organize your thoughts. Before you read the The Washington Post article, *Teens Are Spending More Time Consuming Social Media*, *on Mobile Devices*, write what you already know about the topic in the *Know* column.


    **Note**: If this is your first time using a KLW organizer, the **K** column is where you write what you already KNOW about a topic, the **L** column is where you write anything new that you LEARNED after reading/investigating about how teens spend their time, and the **W**
    column is where you write what you still WANT TO LEARN (or wonderings that you might have) about how teens spend their time.

8. Now read the article:<br>
    [https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html "https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html")

9. As you read, complete the *Learn* column of the KLW graphic organizer with anything new that you learned from the article about how teens spend their time.

10. After you have finished reading the article, complete the *Want to Learn* column.

11. When reading a newspaper, magazine, or blog that includes statistical analysis, it is important to **evaluate**, or think carefully, about **claims** that these articles state as fact.

12. Now that you have identified what you *Know*, *Learned*, and *Want to Learn* about this article, evaluate the article based on the questions below:

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Who was observed and what were the variables observed? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What statistical questions might this article be asking? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Who collected the data? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> How was the data collected? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What claim(s) did the article make? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some statistics that the article used to make the claim(s)? </strong>
    
13. Check your understanding of the above questions. Here are some possible responses:
    100. <span style="color:grey">***A group of 8 to 18-year-olds were observed, and the variables observed had to do with consuming media - watching TV, listening to music, surfing the Internet, playing video games, and spending time on mobile devices.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***A possible statistical question is "How much time per day does today's typical 8 to 18-year-old spend consuming media?"; but you may have to share your statistical questions with your teacher/classmates.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***There were 3 sources cited. The Kaiser Family Foundation collected data for a 2010 study, the Pew Internet and American Life Project collected data in a 2011 study, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics collected data in 2011 with the American Time Use Survey.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Two were studies whose data collection method is not stated, and one is a survey.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Main claim: "Today's teens spend more than 7.5 hours a day consuming media."***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some examples are "Teens use their cellphones to send an average of 60 texts a day", or "On average, high school students spend less than one hour per weekday on sports, exercise, and recreation."***</span>

14. Just as you explored time use via the New York Times interactive graphic, you will now be observing and recording your own daily time use. You will be using the *Time Use Data Collection Worksheet* to organize your time use data before submitting it to the *Time Use* campaign. You will complete one worksheet for each day (5 days total).


    So that you can remember your overall daily time use more easily, each daily worksheet is split into 3 sections: 

    100. 6am-3pm (should total 540 minutes)
    100. 3pm-9pm (should total 360 minutes)
    100. 9pm-6am (should total 540 minutes)


    Once you've filled in the times for each activity, the form will autocalculate the total time across activities for each section of the day, as well as a final total for the entire day (bottom right), which should add to 1,440 minutes. Each day you will transfer your data from the *Time Use Data Collection Worksheet* to the campaign.


    Watch this video to learn how to fill out the *Time Use Data Collection Worksheet*.
