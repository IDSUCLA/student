##***<u>Lesson 15: Americans’ Time on Task</u>***

###**Objective**
Introduction to the *Time Use* campaign. You will explore The New York Times multimedia graphic,
*How Different Groups Spend Their Time* to spark interest in thinking about how you spend your time. You will
begin to learn how to evaluate reports that make claims based on data by reading The Washington Post
article, *Teens Are Spending More Time Consuming Social Media*, *on Mobile Devices*.


###**Vocabulary**
evaluate, claim

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 15 Essential Concepts"
    Learning to examine other analyses is an important part of statistical thinking.
    
###**Lesson**
1. Click on [Campaign Guidelines - Time Use](campaign2.md) (the link can also be found on the left side of this page) and take a look at the guidelines - 
particularly the big questions - to get familiar with the next campaign. 

2. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some predictions you might make based on the big questions in the *Time Use* campaign
guidelines? </strong>

3. In this lesson you will be exploring time use through an interactive graphic based on data from The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which collects data about Americans’
daily time use.

4. Go to the multimedia graphic at the following URL:<br>
    [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0 "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0")
    If the graphic doesn't appear, you need to download the latest version of Flash Player. This can be done by clicking on the link that says "here" (see image  below) once you are on the website.

5. Spend some time exploring the interactive graphic, then answer the
following questions:

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What variables are represented in this graphic? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Explain what the graphic is telling you. </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Where did the data come from? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some interesting findings?</strong>

6. Check your understanding of the above questions:
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The variables represented are activities that Americans spend their time doing. These include sleeping, eating, traveling, socializing, etc.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some examples might be: The graphic shows how much time Americans over the age of 15 are spending doing these activities. This information is broken down by different categories of Americans (e.g., gender, ethnicity), and the percentage of Americans doing a particular activity at a particular time (e.g., 5% of Americans are working at 6:00 am). The average time spent on a particular activity is also shown (e.g., average time spent at work for all Americans is 3 hours and 25 minutes).***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The data came from thousands of Americans over the age of 15 who took a survey recalling every minute of a day in 2008.***</span>

7. You will continue to investigate Americans’ daily time use and use the KLW
graphic organizer as a way to organize your thoughts. 


    **Note**: If this is your first time using KLW organizer, the **K** column is where you write what you already KNOW about a topic, the **L** column is where you write anything new that you LEARNED after reading/investigating about how teens spend their time, and the **W**
    column is where you write what you still WANT TO LEARN (or wonderings that you might have) about how teens spend their time.


    | **K** | **L** | **W** |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |

    <strong style="color: red;">Before you read the The Washington Post article, *Teens Are Spending
More Time Consuming Social Media*, *on Mobile Devices*, write what you already know
about the topic in the *Know* column.</strong>
  

8. Next, read the article:<br>
    [https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html "https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/teens-are-spending-moretime-consuming-media-on-mobile-devices/2013/03/12/309bb242-8689-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html")

9. <strong style="color: red;"> As you read, complete the *Learn* column of the KLW graphic organizer with anything new that you learned from the article about how teens spend their time.</strong>

10. <strong style="color: red;"> After you have finished reading the article, complete the *Want to Learn* column. </strong>

11. When reading a newspaper, magazine, or blog that includes statistical analysis, it is important to
**evaluate**, or think carefully, about **claims** that these articles state as fact.

12. Now that you have identified what you *Know*, *Learned*, and *Want to Learn* about this article, evaluate the article based on the questions below:

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Who was observed and what were the variables observed? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What statistical questions might this article be asking? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Who collected the data? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> How was the data collected? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What claim(s) did the article make? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What are some statistics that the article used to make the claim(s)? </strong>
    
13. Check your understanding of the above questions:
    100. <span style="color:grey">***A group of 8 to 18-year-olds were observed, and the variables observed had to do with consuming media - watching TV, listening to music, surfing the Web, playing video games, and the time spent on mobile devices.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***A possible statistical question is "How much time per day does today's typical 8 to 18-year-old spend consuming media?"; but you may have to share your statistical questions with your teacher/classmates.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***There were 3 sources cited. The Kaiser Family Foundation collected data for a 2010 study, the Pew Internet and American Life Project collected data in a 2011 study, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics collected data in 2011 with the American Time Use Survey.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Two were studies whose data collection method is not stated, and one is a survey.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Main claim: "Today's teens spend more than 7.5 hours a day consuming media."***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some examples are "Teens use their cellphones to send an average of 60 texts a day", or "On average, high school students spent less than one hour per weekday on sports, exercise, and recreation."***</span>

14. You will engage in the *Time Use* Participatory Sensing campaign and will
begin to collect data about your own time use. Follow the *Time Use Campaign Guidelines*.

    **Reminder**: Once logged into the app or the browser-based version, go to
    **Campaigns** to see the full list of campaigns. You can then choose/add the
    campaign you want (in this case, the *Time Use* campaign). If no campaigns are visible, click the **Refresh** option.

15. Just as you explored time use via the New York Times interactive graphic, you will now be observing and recording your own daily time use. You should fill out the *Time Use Data Collection Template* to organize your time use data before submitting it to the *Time Use* campaign. 

    <strong style="color: blue;"> Insert time use data collection template here and maybe an example video/image of how to fill it out? </strong>

    So that you may calculate your overall daily time use more easily, the template is split into 3 sections: 

    100. 6am-3pm (should total 540 minutes)
    100. 3pm-9pm (should total 360 minutes)
    100. 9pm-6am (should total 540 minutes)

    You'll add across each activity row to get the total time spent doing that activity. The final total for each entire day should add to 1440 minutes. These numbers will go in the TOTALS sections of the template.
