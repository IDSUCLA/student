##***<u>Lesson 3: Data Structures</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn that data can be represented in rectangular format.

###**Vocabulary:**
variables, numerical variables, categorical variables, rows, columns, rectangular or spreadsheet format,
variability

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Variables record values that vary. By organizing data into rectangular format, we
    can easily see the characteristics of observations by reading across a row, or we can see the variability in
    a variable by reading down the column. Computers can easily process data when it is rectangular format.

###**Lesson:**

1. During the previous lesson, you briefly learned what **variables** are . Create your own definition of the term “variables.”

2. Using the *Stick Figure* information from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md), come up with a set of
variable names that describe the different categories of information. It is best when
variable names are short (one to three words). 

    How do your variable names compare to ours? *Stick Figures* variable names: Name, Height, GPA, Shoe or Shoe Type, Sport, Friends or Number of Friends.

3. How are the values from “Shoe” different than the values from “Height?”

4. The “Shoe” variable consists of categories or groupings, and the
“Height” variable consists of numbers. Therefore, we can classify variables into two types:
**categorical variables** and **numerical variables**. Typically, categorical variables represent
values that have words, while numerical variables represent values that have numbers.

    **Note:** Categorical variables can sometimes be coded as numbers (e.g., “Gender” could have
    values 0 and 1, where 0=Male and 1=Female).

5. Determine which variables from the *Stick Figures* data are numerical, and which
variables are categorical.

6. Although we can understand many different representations of data (as evidenced by
the posters from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md)), computers are not as capable. Instead, we need to organize data in a
structured way so that a computer can read and interpret them.

7. One way to organize the data is to create a **data table** that consists of **rows** and **columns**. We
can define this type of organization as **rectangular format**, or **spreadsheet format**.

8. On the table below, the columns are the
vertical portions of the table, while the rows are the horizontal portions. Another way to think of it
is that columns go from top to bottom, and rows go from left to right.

9. 
    100. What should each row represent?

    100. What should each column represent?

10. Copy the table below:

    <img src="../../img/10310.png" />

11. Complete the data table using all 8 of the *Stick Figures* cards. Each row
of the table should represent one person on a card.

12. Answer the following questions:

    100. Do any of the people in the data have the same value for a given variable? In other words,
    does a value appear more than once in a column? Give two examples.
 
    100. Do any of the people in the data have different values for a given variable?

13. The term **variability**. As in question (b) above, the values for each variable vary
depending on which person we are observing. This shows that the data has variability, and the
first step in any investigation is to notice variability. We can see the relationship between the
terms **variable** and **variability**. The word “variable” indicates that values vary.
