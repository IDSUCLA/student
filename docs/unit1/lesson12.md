##***<u>Lesson 12: Exploring Food Habits</u>***

###**Objective**
You will experience the full Data Cycle, and for the first time will do so with data you have collected.
You will use two tools that are easy to learn: the Dashboard and the PlotApp.


###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 12 Essential Concepts"
    Once Participatory Sensing data has been collected, the Dashboard and PlotApp
    perform the analysis step of the Data Cycle, though humans need to tell the computer which plots we
    wish to examine.
    

###**Lesson**
1. Reflect about your experience so far with the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign by completing the *Food Habits Check-In* handout ([LMR_1.11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.11_Food Habits Check-In.pdf)).

2. Today you will engage in a full Data Cycle with your class's food habits data. You will use the Dashboard and the Plot App to generate visualizations of the variables collected about your snacks. You will then formulate and answer statistical questions that can be answered by the visualizations.

3. To access the Dashboard, go to the IDS Homepage, found at
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org"). All of the IDS web tools can be accessed through this page.

4. Click on **Dashboard** and log in if prompted. Once logged in, notice that you are redirected to the **Campaign Manager**. This happens so that you can select the campaign containing the data that you want to analyze. Find the *Food Habits* campaign and click on **Dashboard**.

5. You will be navigating the Dashboard using the *Exploring Our Food Habits* handout as a guide. 

    **Note**: If you are unable to print the handout or access it electronically, you can create a table in your Data Science Journal that follows the same format.

6. Dashboard

    100. Plot 1: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">time</strong> variable, use the *Response Time* histogram. If you do not see the *Response Time* plot, you may have to click on the blue histogram icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Plot 2: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">salty_sweet</strong> variable, use the *Salty or Sweet?* donut plot. If you do not see the *Salty or Sweet?* plot, you may have to click on the donut plot icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Plot 3: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">calories</strong> variable, use the *Calories per Serving* histogram. If you do not see the *Calories per Serving* plot, you may have to click on the purple histogram icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Plot 4: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">why</strong> variable, use the *Why* word cloud. If you do not see the *Why* word cloud, you may have to click on the word cloud icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.

7. Now you will use the Plot App to analyze the Food Habits data. The Plot App is less rigid than the Dashboard in that it allows us to create plots with more than one variable. To access the Plot App, go to the IDS Homepage, found at
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org"). All of the IDS web tools can be accessed through this page.

8. Click on **Plot App** and log in if prompted. Once logged in, notice that you are redirected to the **Campaign Manager**. This happens so that you can select the campaign containing the data that you want to analyze. Find the *Food Habits* campaign and click on **PlotApp**.

9. You will be navigating the Plot App using the *Exploring Our Food Habits* handout as a guide. 

    **Note**: If you are unable to print the handout or access it electronically, you can create a table in your Data Science Journal that follows the same format.

10. Plot App 
    
    100. Plot 1: Select <strong style="color: purple;">healthy_level</strong> under the x-axis drop-down on the left-hand side. Select <strong style="color: purple;">serving_size</strong> under the y-axis drop-down on the left-hand side. Scroll down and click on **Update Plot** to view the corresponding plot.
    100. Plot 2: Follow the same instructions as you did for Plot 1, but instead use <strong style="color: purple;">salty_sweet</strong> for the x-axis and <strong style="color: purple;">calories</strong> for the y-axis. 
    100. Plot 3: Follow the same instructions as you did for Plots 1 and 2, but instead use <strong style="color: purple;">calories</strong> for the x-axis and <strong style="color: purple;">total_fat</strong> for the y-axis.
    100. Plot 4: Keep the same variables on the x-axis and y-axis as in Plot 3, but add a Facet to this plot by selecting <strong style="color: purple;">salty_sweet</strong> under the Facet drop down on the left-hand side. Remember to scroll down and click **Update Plot** to view the corresponding plot. 
    
        <strong style="color: red;">How does adding a Facet change the plot? What additional information is gained?</strong>
    
11. Once completed, you will turn in the handout for assessment.

###**Reflection**
<strong style="color: red;"> Write a paragraph summarizing the most important things you learned in the last 3 lessons. </strong>

You will continue to collect nutritional facts data using the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign on your smart device or via web browser.
