##***<u>Lesson 12: Exploring Food Habits</u>***

###**Objective**
You will experience the full Data Cycle, and for the first time will do so with data you have collected.
You will use two tools that are easy to learn: the Dashboard and the PlotApp.


###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 12 Essential Concepts"
    Once Participatory Sensing data has been collected, the Dashboard and PlotApp
    perform the analysis step of the Data Cycle, though humans need to tell the computer which plots we
    wish to examine.
    

###**Lesson**
1. Reflect about your experience so far with the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign by completing the *Food Habits Check-In* handout.


    <strong style="color: black;"> Click on the document name to download a fillable copy of the </strong>[*Food Habits Check-In* handout (LMR_1.11)](https://ucla.box.com/s/z4sakwv5y6d331kgvjqcpg5sknmq3qtj).

2. Today you will engage in a full Data Cycle with your class's food habits data. You will use the Dashboard and the Plot App to generate visualizations of the variables collected about your snacks. You will then formulate and answer statistical questions that can be answered by the visualizations.

3. You're going to be using the Dashboard to analyze the times that surveys were submitted <strong style="color: purple;">(time</strong> variable), your class's preference for salty or sweet snacks <strong style="color: purple;">(salty_sweet</strong> variable), the calories in your snacks <strong style="color: purple;">(calories</strong> variable), and the reason you ate the snack <strong style="color: purple;">(why</strong> variable). 

4. First let's learn how to access and navigate the Dashboard by watching this video:

5.  Now that you've gotten an overview of how to use the Dashboard, you will be navigating the Dashboard using the *Exploring Our Food Habits, Part 1* handout as a guide.


    **Note**: If you are unable to print the handout or access it electronically, you can create a table in your IDS Journal that follows the same format.


    <strong style="color: black;"> Click on the document name to download a fillable copy of the </strong>[*Exploring Our Food Habits, Part 1* handout (LMR_1.12a)](https://ucla.box.com/s/td703kqvcec9tisw2152teqj1r47hgnz).

6. Watch this video to get you started on completing LMR_1.12a *Exploring Our Food Habits, Part 1*:


    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UW9yARYvPEE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


7. Now it's your turn! Go to the IDS Servers page, found at
[https://idsucla.org/ids-servers](https://www.idsucla.org/ids-servers "https://www.idsucla.org/ids-servers") and find your school or district's server. All of the IDS web tools can be accessed through this page. Click on *Dashboard* and log in if prompted. Once logged in, notice that you are redirected to the *Campaign Manager*. This happens so that you can select the campaign containing the data that you want to analyze. Find the *Food Habits* campaign and click on *Dashboard*. 

8. Following are instructions for creating the visuals to analyze the variables mentioned in LMR_1.12a:

    100. Plot 1: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">time</strong> variable, use the *Response Time* histogram. If you do not see the *Response Time* plot, you may have to click on the blue histogram icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Plot 2: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">salty_sweet</strong> variable, use the *Salty or Sweet?* donut plot. If you do not see the *Salty or Sweet?* plot, you may have to click on the donut plot icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Plot 3: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">calories</strong> variable, use the *Calories per Serving* histogram. If you do not see the *Calories per Serving* plot, you may have to click on the purple histogram icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Plot 4: To analyze the <strong style="color: purple;">why</strong> variable, use the *Why* word cloud. If you do not see the *Why* word cloud, you may have to click on the word cloud icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.


9. Now you will use the Plot App to analyze some other Food Habits variables. The Plot App is less rigid than the Dashboard because it allows us to create plots with more than one variable.  

10. Let's learn how to access and navigate the Plot App to complete LMR_1.12b by watching this video:


    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jks39Gxi6dA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


11. Before you begin using the Plot App, download a copy of the *Exploring Our Food Habits, Part 2* handout:

    
    <strong style="color: black;"> Click on the document name to download a fillable copy of the </strong>[*Exploring Our Food Habits, Part 2* handout (LMR_1.12b)](https://ucla.box.com/s/r86qweoy0v7obb9bpfsebdt82tbguu5g).

       
    <iframe src="https://app.box.com/embed/s/r86qweoy0v7obb9bpfsebdt82tbguu5g?sortColumn=date&view=list" width="500" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


12. To access the Plot App, go to the IDS Homepage, found at
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org"). All of the IDS web tools can be accessed through this page. Click on **Plot App** and log in if prompted. Once logged in, notice that you are redirected to the **Campaign Manager**. This happens so that you can select the campaign containing the data that you want to analyze. Find the *Food Habits* campaign and click on **PlotApp**.


13. The following are instructions for creating the visuals for LMR_1.12b using the Plot App:
    
    100. Plot 1: Select <strong style="color: purple;">healthy_level</strong> under the x-axis drop-down on the left-hand side. Select <strong style="color: purple;">serving_size</strong> under the y-axis drop-down on the left-hand side. Scroll down and click on **Update Plot** to view the corresponding plot.
    100. Plot 2: Follow the same instructions as you did for Plot 1, but instead use <strong style="color: purple;">salty_sweet</strong> for the x-axis and <strong style="color: purple;">calories</strong> for the y-axis. 
    100. Plot 3: Follow the same instructions as you did for Plots 1 and 2, but instead use <strong style="color: purple;">calories</strong> for the x-axis and <strong style="color: purple;">total_fat</strong> for the y-axis.
    100. Plot 4: Keep the same variables on the x-axis and y-axis as in Plot 3, but add a Facet to this plot by selecting <strong style="color: purple;">salty_sweet</strong> under the Facet drop down on the left-hand side. Remember to scroll down and click **Update Plot** to view the corresponding plot. 


8. Once completed, you will turn in both handouts for assessment.
