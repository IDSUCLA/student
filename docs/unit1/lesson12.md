##***<u>Lesson 12: Exploring Food Habits</u>***

###**Objective**
You will experience the full Data Cycle, and for the first time will do so with data you have collected.
You will use the Dashboard and PlotApp, tools that are easy to learn.


###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Once Participatory Sensing data has been collected, the Dashboard and PlotApp
    perform the analysis step of the Data Cycle, though humans need to tell the computer which plots we
    wish to examine.
    

###**Lesson**
1. Reflect about your experience so far with the Food Habits Participatory Sensing
campaign by completing the *Food Habits Check-In* handout ([LMR_1.11](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.11_Food Habits Check-In.pdf)).

2. To access the **IDS Homepage**, go to 
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")

3. All of the IDS web tools can be accessed through this page.

4. For this lesson, you will learn how to use the **Campaign Manager**, the
**Dashboard**, and the **PlotApp**.

5. Click on the Campaign Manager. Selecting any of the web tools on the IDS page
without logging in first will redirect you to the login prompt.

6. To log in to access the IDS software suite you will use the
same login information that you have used to collect data on your mobile device or the browser-based
version.

    The Campaign Manager is the place where you will access,
    download, and export your campaign data in subsequent lessons. It also provides
    shortcuts to the Dashboard and PlotApp. The Campaign Manager allows you to view
    and learn about the campaigns in which you are participating, and to edit the campaigns
    you will be creating later in this course. Go to the drop-down menu on the right-hand
    side and look for the **Responses** tab.
    The Responses tab for this lesson allows you to view, delete, or share your data,
    and to view shared data contributed by other users of the campaign.

7. Take out the *Exploring Our Food Habits* handout ([LMR_1.12](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.12_Exploring Our Food Habits.pdf)).

8. You will be navigating through the IDS website as you follow
along in the *Exploring Our Food Habits* handout ([LMR_1.12](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.12_Exploring Our Food Habits.pdf)). **<u>Note:</u>** if you are unable to print the handout or access it electronically, you can create a table in your DS Journal that follows the same format

    100. Go back to the IDSUCLA home page. Click on the Campaign Manager. On the right drop down for your Food Habits Campaign, click on Dashboard. We will be using the Dashboard for plots 1 through 4.
    100. For plot 1: <strong style="color: red;"> Use the Response Time histogram plot for your handout sketch and statistical questions (remember to label your axes and scales in your sketch). </strong> If you do not see the Response Time plot, you may have to click on the blue histogram icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. For plot 2: <strong style="color: red;"> Use the Salty or Sweet? donut plot for your handout sketch and statistical questions (remember to label your variables in your sketch). </strong> If you do not see the Salty or Sweet? plot, you may have to click on the donut plot icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browswer viewing space.
    100. For plot 3: <strong style="color: red;"> Use the Calories per Serving histogram plot for your handout sketch and statistial questions (remember to label your axes and scales in your sketch). </strong> If you do not see the Calories per Serving plot, you may have to click on the purple histogram icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. For plot 4: <strong style="color: red;"> Use the Why word cloud for your handout sketch and statistial questions. </strong> If you do not see the Why word cloud, you may have to click on the word cloud icon in the top menu bar of the Dashboard or enlarge your browser viewing space.
    100. Go back to the IDSUCLA home page. Click on the Campaign Manager. On the right drop down for your Food Habits Campaign, click on PlotApp. You will be using the PlotApp for the next plots 1 through 4.
    100. For PlotApp plot 1: Select healthy_level under the x-axis drop down on the left-hand side. Also select serving_size under the y-axis drop down on the left-hand side. Then scroll down to Update Plot to view the corresponding plot. <strong style="color: red;"> Sketch the resulting plot, including its axes and scales, and create 1-2 statistical questions based on this plot on your handout. </strong>
    100. For PlotApp plot 2: Follow the same instructions as you did for PlotApp plot 1 but instead with salty_sweet as the x-axis and calories as the y-axis. <strong style="color: red;"> Sketch the resulting plot and create 1-2 statistial questions regarding it. </strong>
    100. For PlotApp plot 3: Follow the same instructions as you did for PlotApp plots 1 and 2 but instead with calories as the x-axis and total_fat as the y-axis. <strong style="color: red;"> Sketch the resulting plot and create 1-2 statistial questions regarding it. </strong>
    100. For PlotApp plot 4: Keep the same x-axis and y-axis variables as you had in PlotApp plot 3 but you will be adding a Facet to this plot. Select salty_sweet under the Facet drop down on the left-hand side. Then scroll down to Update Plot to view the corresponding plot. <strong style="color: red;"> Sketch the resulting plot, including its axes and scales, and create 1-2 statistical questions based on this plot on your handout. How does adding a Facet change the plot? What additional information is gained? </strong>
    
9. Once completed, you will turn in the handout for assessment.

###**Reflection:**
<strong style="color: red;"> Write a paragraph summarizing the most important things you learned in the last 3 lessons. </strong>
