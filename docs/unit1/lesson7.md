##***<u>Lesson 7: Setting the Stage* [The Data Cycle: Collect Data]</u>**

###**Objective**
You will begin to collect and record data to learn more about your own eating habits, as well as those
of your classmates. You will learn about data that is collected by a Participatory Sensing campaign, and
also about privacy issues and photo ethics when collecting and sharing data.

###**Vocabulary**
Participatory Sensing, campaign, surveys, images, GPS, ethics, photo ethics

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    In Participatory Sensing, we humans behave as if we are robot sensors, collecting
    data whenever a "trigger" event occurs. Our ability to learn about the patterns in our life through these
    data depends on our being reliable data collectors.

!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    For every single lesson:
    
    Answer the questions in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> font in your Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Journal.

###**Lesson**
1. In this lesson you will become familiar with the *Food Habits Campaign* guidelines (found on the link after this lesson).
There are big questions found under “The Issues,” to help guide you during the
campaign.

2. Your teacher will distribute your username and password (make sure to not share this information with anyone else). You will need this username and password when you are ready to download the [IDS UCLA
app](../download/app.md).

3. Think about the Nutritional Facts labels from which you collected data in the
previous lesson, and answer the following in your DS journals:

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What questions would you want answered about eating habits? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What can you do to find out about your own eating habits? </strong>

4. Now refer back to your reactions and comments from Jamie Oliver’s video and ponder the following question: *What am I really eating?*

5. Over the next 9 days, you will engage in a **Participatory Sensing campaign** in which you will
act as human sensors to collect data about yourself. The data collected will be used to
analyze your classmates’ and your own snacking habits.

6. For this campaign, you will collect data about every snack you eat.

    **<u>Note:</u>** You should **NOT** collect data for full meals like breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Data should
    only be collected for anything eaten in between meals, like fruit, chips, cookies, nuts, sodas, etc.

7. <strong style="color: red;">Why does it makes sense to study snacks specifically? Brainstorm some questions that
could be answered using the snack-only data that would be hard to answer if the data included
meals as well. </strong>

8. You will be taking part in a specific data collection method know as
**Participatory Sensing** via a mobile application. This application can gather data via **surveys**,
**images**, and **GPS** tracking.

9. The reason you are collecting the data is to learn more about
yourself and your classmates, NOT to provide data for an external data collection team.
(Occasionally, there has been a misconception that when you use the Participatory Sensing app,
you are providing data to external researchers, such as UCLA. This is not the case.)

10. You are now going to engage in your own first Participatory Sensing data
collection experience, in which you will collect your own data using a smart device. Depending on the device, there are 3 different options available:

    100. **Android.** A native Android application called “[IDS UCLA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.ucla.oit.idsucla)” is available from the [Google
    Play Store](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en).

    100. **iOS (Apple devices)** The mobile application called “[IDS UCLA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ids-ucla/id1422869521)” is available from the iOS
    App Store.

    100. **No mobile device - browser-based version.** If you do not have a mobile
    device (or an unsupported device, such as a Windows phone or Blackberry), a browser-based
    version to perform data collection is available at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")<br>
    Click on the **Survey Taking icon** on the page.

    The video below shows a detailed explanation of how to download and use the IDSUCLA app to take a survey.

11. Once you have downloaded the app or have found the website, take out your login information to log in to the app. You need to keep this information in a safe place for the
entire duration of this course. **It is incredibly important to keep your username and
password confidential.**
If you have trouble with your login, your teacher has the ability to reset your password.

12. Once logged into the app or the browser-based version, you will see the **Campaigns** in
which you will participate. You will then select the campaign by tapping the name of the
campaign. If no campaigns are visible, tap the refresh option, located on the top right
hand side of the screen.

13. Using one of your nutrition facts cutouts or pictures, complete your first survey by
going through the questions in the app.

14. After you've had the opportunity to complete at least one survey, <strong style="color: red;"> write the
meaning of the word **ethics** in your DS Journal. </strong> For this course, you will need to understand **photo ethics**. You
may NOT take pictures of any person’s identifying features such as faces, hair, hands, tattoos,
etc. For this campaign, you may only take pictures of your snacks and/or the nutrition facts labels.

    **<u>Note:</u>** Your teacher will inspect all students’ data collection photos throughout the data collection period
    and before each data collection, monitoring to ensure that no inappropriate images are shared. If they
     believe a photo is inappropriate, they will delete the data entry immediately.

15. Setting reminders: The [IDS UCLA app](../download/app.md) has a reminder feature to help you in your data
collection journey. You can set reminders directly on the app by tapping the
menu button on the top left hand side of the screen and selecting **Reminders** from the menu.

16. Data collection norms: Your teacher will ask the class how many snacks they think they eat a day. From this, as a class you will
come up with an approximate number of surveys you think each student should complete during
the data collection period.

17. Remember that your teacher will be monitoring your data collection to make sure that everyone is
submitting surveys regularly.

18. Refer to the previous day’s homework. <strong style="color: red;"> Now that you've had the opportunity to collect and record data for the *Food Habits Campaign*, what are some predictions you have about possible responses to your 2 simple statistical questions and 2 complex statistical questions? </strong>

For the next 9 days, you will collect nutritional facts data using the *Food Habits* Participatory
Sensing campaign on your smart device or via web browser.
