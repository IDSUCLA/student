#Unit1, Section2: Visualizing Data
Instructional Days: 14

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Enduring Understandings**</p>
Data collection methods affect what we can know about the real world. Visual representations help tell
stories with data. Distributions of numerical and categorical variables help describe variability in the data.
Technology and computers allow us to visualize complex relationships in data.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Engagement**</p>
Students will view the video called *The Value of Data Visualization* to help them understand the
importance of graphical representations of data. Discussion questions will allow students to begin to think
about how they would want see a data set visualized. The video can be found at:

*<u>Statistical/Mathematical:</u>* 

S-ID 1: Represent data with plots on the real number line (dotplots, histograms, bar plots, and boxplots).

S-ID 3: Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for
possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).

S-ID 6: Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatterplot and describe how the variables are
related.

*<u>Data Science:</u>*

Create visualizations with data. Learn the difference between plots used for categorical and numerical
variables. Interpret and understand graphs of distributions for numerical and categorical variables.

*<u>Applied Computational Thinking Using RStudio:</u>*

• Learn to download, load, upload, and work with data using RStudio syntax and structure.

• Create appropriate graphical displays of data.

• Differentiate between observations and variables.

• Learn to use objects, functions, and assignments.

*<u>Real-World Connections:</u>*

Students will continue to understand that data on its own is just collected; but once interpreted, it can lead
to discoveries or understandings.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will use complex sentences to construct summary statements about their understanding
of data, how it is collected, how it is used and how to work with it.

2. Students will engage in partner and whole group discussions and presentations to express their
understanding of data science concepts.

3. Students will use complex sentences to write informative short reports that use data science
concepts and skills.

*<u>Data Files:</u>*

1. Students’ *Food Habits Campaign* Data

2. CDC Data File
