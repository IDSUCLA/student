##***<u>Lesson 9: What is Typical?</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn about the typical value when looking at a distribution by finding the “center” and
determining any point clusters.

###**Vocabulary:**
typical, center, shape, spread

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    The “center” of a distribution is a deliberately vague term, but it is one way to
    answer the subjective question "what is a typical value?" The center could be the perceived balancing
    point or the value that approximately cuts the area of the distribution in half.

###**Lesson:**
1. **<u>Food Habits Campaign Data Collection Monitoring:</u>**

    100. The IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool is found on your IDS Homepage.
    Click on **Monitor** and sign in if prompted. Find the Food Habits Campaign and click on Monitor.
    Note: If you haven't submitted any data, the page will be blank.

    100. Your teacher will be monitoring the class data collection again today.

        200. See *User List* and sort by *Total*. <strong style="color: red;">Who has collected the most data so far?</strong>

        200. Click on the pie chart. <strong style="color: red;">How many active users are there? How many inactive
        users are there?</strong>

        200. See *Total Responses*. <strong style="color: red;">How many responses have been submitted?</strong>
        
        200. <strong style="color: red;">What can you do to increase your data collection?</strong>

2. Today you will be learning about a distribution’s **typical** value.

3. Brainstorm characteristics of the "typical" student. <strong style="color: red;">Does the typical 12th grader
differ from the typical 9th grader? How so?</strong>

4. <strong style="color: red;">Write down synonyms to the word “typical” in your DS journal.</strong>

5. Below is a bubble map with synonyms that the stick figures brainstormed for typical. <strong style="color: red;">Using these synonyms, along with yours, indicate which terms apply best to categorical variables and which terms apply 
best to numerical variables.</strong><strong style="color: blue;">Find a picture of a bubble map from PD or from an actual IDS class</strong>


6. Consider the dotplot of the distribution of calories (from [lesson 8](lesson8.md)). <strong style="color: blue;">Use the same image from lesson 8 # 19.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What value might you consider to be the typical value of this distribution? Why?</strong>

    100. A good way to gauge where the typical value of a distribution lies is to look for the following:
 
        200. Clustering/clumps of data.

        200. Values where most of the observations are between.

        200. Overall range of the data.

7. Reconsider the typical number of calories in the dotplot. <strong style="color: red;">What is the typical amount of calories in the stick figure's snacks? Use one of the synonyms for typical from #5.</strong>

8. Answer the following in your IDS journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Which synonyms are associated with “center”? Is this concept of **center** useful for
    numerical or categorical variables?</strong>

9. The value at the center of the distribution often matches up with our everyday
notion of the typical value of a distribution. The middle observation is not always the typical value.

10. Defining the center of a distribution depends on many things, such as the placement of points in
the distribution (known as the **shape**) and how dense the distribution is at certain values (known
as the **spread**).

11. If you were to ask a group of high school students to write down the number of hours of sleep they got during a school night:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the typical value will be?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the lowest value will be?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the highest value will be?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the shape of the distribution will look like?</strong>

12. Below is the distribution of number of hours slept on a school night by high school students. <strong style="color: red;">Is the typical value similar to what you originally thought? The shape? The
variability? Why or why not?</strong> <strong style="color: blue;">Find a poster or create one with a dotplot of number of hours slept</strong>

13. If you were to ask the same group of high school students to write down the number of hours they plan to sleep on a Saturday:
<strong style="color: red;">How do you think this plot will differ from the first plot? Focus your explanation on the shape, center,
and spread of the distributions.</strong>
