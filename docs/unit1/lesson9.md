##***<u>Lesson 9: What is Typical?</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn about the typical value when looking at a distribution by finding the “center” and
determining any point clusters.

###**Vocabulary**
typical, center, shape, spread

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    The “center” of a distribution is a deliberately vague term, but it is one way to
    answer the subjective question "what is a typical value?" The center could be the perceived balancing
    point or the value that approximately cuts the area of the distribution in half.

###**Lesson**
1. **<u>Food Habits Campaign Data Collection Monitoring:</u>**

    100. The IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool is found on your IDS Homepage, found at
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org").
    Click on **Monitor** and sign in if prompted. Once logged in, notice that you are redirected to the **Campaign Manager**. This happens so that you can select the campaign that you want to monitor. Find the Food Habits Campaign and click on Monitor. If you haven't submitted any data, the page will be blank.
    
    **Note:** To review how to access the Monitoring Tool, refer to the video in lesson 8 #1 a.

    100. Your teacher will be monitoring the class data collection again today.

        200. See *User List* and sort by *Total*. <strong style="color: red;">Who has collected the most data so far?</strong>

        200. Click on the pie chart. <strong style="color: red;">How many active users are there? How many inactive
        users are there?</strong>

        200. See *Total Responses*. <strong style="color: red;">How many responses have been submitted?</strong>
        
        200. <strong style="color: red;">What can you do to increase your data collection?</strong>

2. Today you will be learning about a distribution’s **typical** value.

3. Brainstorm characteristics of the "typical" student. <strong style="color: red;">Does the typical 12th grader
differ from the typical 9th grader? How so?</strong>

4. <strong style="color: red;">Write down synonyms to the word “typical” in your DS journal.</strong>

5. Below is a bubble map with synonyms that the stick figures brainstormed for typical. <strong style="color: red;">Using these synonyms, along with yours, indicate which terms apply best to categorical variables and which terms apply 
best to numerical variables.</strong>

6. Consider the dotplot of the distribution of calories (from [lesson 8](lesson8.md)).

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What value might you consider to be the typical value of this distribution? Why?</strong>

    100. A good way to gauge where the typical value of a distribution lies is to look for the following:
 
        200. Clustering/clumps of data.

        200. Values where most of the observations are between.

        200. Overall range of the data.

7. Now that you've been provided with some hints as to how to gauge the typical value of a distrubtion, reconsider the typical number of calories in the dotplot that you reported in 6a. <strong style="color: red;">Do you still feel that what you reported is the typical number or calories in the stick figures' snacks? Why or why not?</strong>

8. Another synonym for the term typical is **center**. **Center**, however, is useful for numerical variables. For example, the typical number of calories in the stick figures' snacks is centered around 100 calories.

9. The value at the **center** of the distribution often matches up with our everyday
notion of the typical value of a distribution. The middle observation is not always the typical value.

10. Defining the center of a distribution depends on many things, such as the placement of points in
the distribution (known as the **shape**) and how dense the distribution is at certain values (known
as the **spread**).

11. If you were to ask a group of high school students to write down the number of hours of sleep they got during a school night:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the typical value will be?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the lowest value will be?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the highest value will be?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the shape of the distribution will look like?</strong>

12. Below is the distribution of number of hours slept on a school night by high school students. <strong style="color: red;">Is the typical value similar to what you originally thought? The shape? The
variability? Why or why not?</strong>

13. If you were to ask the same group of high school students to write down the number of hours they plan to sleep on a Saturday,
<strong style="color: red;">How do you think this plot will differ from the first plot where they reported how many hours they slept on a schoolnight? Make a quick sketch. Focus your explanation on the shape, center,
and spread of the distributions.</strong>

###**Reflection**
<strong style="color: red;"> Write a paragraph summarizing the most important things you learned in the last 3 lessons. </strong>
