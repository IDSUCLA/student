##***<u>Lesson 9: What is Typical?</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn about the typical value when looking at a distribution by finding the “center” and
determining any point clusters.

###**Vocabulary:**
typical, center, shape, spread

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    The “center” of a distribution is a deliberately vague term, but it is one way to
    answer the subjective question "what is a typical value?" The center could be the perceived balancing
    point or the value that approximately cuts the area of the distribution in half.

###**Lesson:**
1. **<u>Food Habits Campaign Data Collection Monitoring:</u>**

    100. The IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool is found on your IDS Homepage.
    Click on **Monitor** and sign in if prompted. Find the Food Habits Campaign and click on Monitor.
    Note: If you haven't submitted any data, the page will be blank.

    100. Your teacher will be monitoring the class data collection again today.

        200. See *User List* and sort by *Total*. <strong style="color: red;">Who has collected the most data so far?</strong>

        200. Click on the pie chart. <strong style="color: red;">How many active users are there? How many inactive
        users are there?</strong>

        200. See *Total Responses*. <strong style="color: red;">How many responses have been submitted?</strong>
        
        200. <strong style="color: red;">What can you do to increase your data collection?</strong>

2. Today you will be learning about a distribution’s **typical** value.

3. <strong style="color: red;">Brainstorm characteristics of the "typical" student. Does the typical 12th grader
differ from the typical 9th grader? How so?</strong>

4. <strong style="color: red;">Write down synonyms to the word “typical” in your DS journals.</strong>

5. <strong style="color: red;">Which terms apply best to categorical variables and which terms apply 
best to numerical variables.</strong>

6. Consider the dotplot from [lesson 8](lesson8.md)). <strong style="color: red;">What value might you consider to be the typical value of this distribution? Why?</strong>

    100. Hopefully, at least one student will choose a value close to the center of the distribution. If
    not, point to a value near the extreme and ask them if they think this is typical. Then
    move closer to the center until they agree on which values are typical.

    100. It is ok to be vague in the definition of typical for today’s lesson. The discussion needs to
    be very teacher-driven. Some possible points of discussion might be:
 
        200. Clustering/clumps of data.

        200. Most of the observations are between <u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> and <u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>.

        200. Overall range of the data.

7. Ask students to reconsider the typical number of sugar grams. What is the typical amount of
sugar (in grams) in our snacks? ***For example, students may come up with the same answer
for different reasons: “The typical amount of sugar grams is 10.” The reasons may include
the data points are half below and half above; it’s the mode; it has plurality.*** Then, tie it
back to the synonyms they provided. Ask: Which synonym are you using?

8. In pairs, ask students to discuss the question:

    100. Which synonyms are associated with “center”? Is this concept of **center** useful for
    numerical or categorical variables? <span style="color:grey">**Center is useful for numerical variables. The
    center of the distribution often corresponds to our notion of ‘typical value.’ For
    example, the typical height of the students in our class might be centered around
    5’5.**</span>

9. Inform students that the value at the center of the distribution often matches up with our everyday
notion of the typical value of a distribution. The middle observation is not always the typical value.
Similarly, the middle person would not always be the center value.

10. Defining the center of a distribution depends on many things, such as the placement of points in
the distribution (known as the **shape**) and how dense the distribution is at certain values (known
as the **spread**).

11. Ask the students to write down the number of hours of sleep they got last night. They will be
creating a dotplot of this data, so ask them:

    100. What do you think the typical value will be?

    100. What do you think the lowest value will be?

    100. What do you think the highest value will be?

    100. What do you think the shape of the distribution will look like?

12. One-by-one, have them come up to the board (or poster paper) and put a dot above the correct
value on the dotplot. After each student has placed a dot on the board, have a discussion about
the distribution. Is the typical value similar to what they originally thought? The shape? The
variability? Why or why not?

13. Next, have the students write down the number of hours of sleep they hope to get this Saturday.
How do they think this plot will differ from the first plot? Focus discussion on the shape, center,
and spread of the distributions. Repeat steps 8-9 and discuss how this plot is similar and/or
different than the first plot.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.
