##***<u>Lesson 4: The Data Cycle</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn about the Data Cycle and will understand what a statistical question is.

###**Vocabulary:**
data cycle, statistical questions, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    A statistical investigation consists of cycling through the four stages of the Data
    Cycle. Statistical questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate
    data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data
    through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected
    data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical questions. Data Analysis is almost
    always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the
    data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical questions.

###**Lesson:**
1. During the past few lessons, we have discussed what data are, how to collect and organize them,
and how their values can vary. But what do we do with all this data? How can we navigate it and
turn it into something useful to us?

2. Today, you will be learning about the **Data Cycle**. The Data Cycle is a guide
we can use when learning to think about data. We always start with asking questions. Here is a
graphic of *The Data Cycle* ([LMR_1.3](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.3_Data Cycle.pdf)):

3. Below is an overview of each component of the **Data Cycle**. We will explore each component more explicitly throughout the course.

    100. **Statistical Questions:** Statistical questions are questions that address variability and
    can be answered with data.

    100. **Data Collection:** This is the process of observing and recording data, or of examining
    previously collected data to make sure it meets the needs of the investigation.

    100. **Data Analysis:** During analysis, tables, graphs, and summaries of the data are produced
    to help us find patterns and relationships.

    100. **Data Interpretation:** The statistical questions are answered by referring to the tables,
    graphs, and summaries made in the Data Analysis phase.

4. To help you get a firm understanding of the Data Cycle and how each component is
connected, you will create a Data Cycle Spinner.

5. To create your own Data Cycle Spinner, look for supplies around your home.

    100. Cardboard or paper, markers, something to insert through the center to make it spin.

6. <strong style="color: red;">Create your own spinner (see example below).</strong>

7. The slides below contain examples of components of the data cycle. 
    <strong style="color: blue;">Insert slides that Carole created where we 
    take students to different parts of the data cycle.</strong>
    <strong style="color: red;">For each slide, answer the following questions: Where in the data cycle are we? Why?</strong>

8. Were you a little skeptical about the statement in slide #3? Why or why not? What did the slide #5 reveal?

9. As informed citizens, we should question claims made by the media.
   

10. The *Bros & Dudes Graphics* handout contains 10 pairings of graphs.

11.  The graphics shown on the handouts were created for the *Quartz* website by Nikhil Sonnad as a data visualization. He collected the data via Twitter. The graphics
show how common certain terms are throughout the United States when referring to friends.([LMR_1.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.5_Bros & Dudes Graphics.pdf))<strong style="color: red;">Choose one of the graphics and come up with 2 questions that could be asked given the particular graphic you chose.</strong>

12. Write down the 4 components of the Data Cycle, then
use your spinner to see if you can make it all the way through with your chosen questions. You
should record notes about whether or not each component can be completed, and why.

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Create a small Data Cycle graphic using ONE of your questions to turn
    in for assessment (suggested size is 8.5”x11”). The cycle should be clearly labeled and
    have appropriate responses for each of the 4 components.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Your graphic must make a conclusion about why your question was or was not a
    statistical question.</strong>

13. If you have questions that are not statistical, reformulate them into statistical
questions for homework.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Reformulate any non-statistical questions generated about the *Bros & Dudes
Graphics* handout into statistical questions.
