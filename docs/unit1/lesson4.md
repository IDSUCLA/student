##***<u>Lesson 4: The Data Cycle</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn about the Data Cycle and its components.

###**Vocabulary**
data cycle, statistical questions, consider data, data analysis, data interpretation

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    A statistical investigation involves  answering a research question by posing and answering statistical questions using data. The Data Cycle is a guide for carrying out a statistical investigation, and you should visit each stage of the Data Cycle at least once in an investigation. The Consider Data phase might simply involve examining a dataset to see which variables it has and considering which of those variables can be used to answer your question.Data Analysis is almost always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical questions.

!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    For every single lesson:
    
    Answer the questions in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> font in your Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Journal.

###**Lesson**
1. During the past few lessons, we have discussed what data are, how to collect and organize them,
and how their values can vary. But what do we do with all this data? How can we navigate it and
turn it into something useful to us?

2. Today you will be learning about the **Data Cycle**. The **Data Cycle** is a guide
we can use when learning to think about data. We typically start with asking questions. Here is a
graphic of *The Data Cycle* ([LMR_1.3](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.3_Data Cycle.pdf)):

3. Below is an overview of each component of the **Data Cycle**. We will explore each component more explicitly throughout the course.

    100. **Statistical Questions:** Statistical questions are questions that address variability and
    can be answered with data.

    100. **Consider Data:** This is the process of observing and recording data, or of examining
    previously collected data to make sure it meets the needs of the investigation.

    100. **Data Analysis:** During analysis, tables, graphs, and summaries of the data are produced
    to help us find patterns and relationships.

    100. **Data Interpretation:** The statistical questions are answered by referring to the tables,
    graphs, and summaries made in the Data Analysis phase.

4. To help you get a firm understanding of the **Data Cycle**, we will apply it to the story of a pizza delivery person in Austin, Texas. This pizza delivery person kept a blog using the name "Pizza Girl." Pizza girl recorded detailed notes of how she spent her time at work on her blog. While she was in the pizza shop, Pizza Girl was paid by the hour; but when she went out to make deliveries she had to clock out, and the only money she made was what she received in tips. This got Pizza Girl thinking, <i>"How is my time most profitably spent?"</i> To help her answer this research question, she began considering her tips.

    100. **Statistical Question:** Does method of payment affect my tip?
    
        Pizza Girl wondered if she made more tip money from deliveries to customers who pre-paid, or from those that paid in cash, credit card, or with a check?

    100. **Consider Data:** The image below shows how Pizza Girl recorded her data. We see the information is there, but we may need to put it in another structure in order to analyze it with a computer. For example, we may need to organize it on a spreadsheet with the columns Tips, Payment Method and Time.

    100. **Data Analysis:** Pizza Girl made an attempt to analyze her data but wasn't completely happy. Coincidentally, a statistician who was searching for good pizza came across her blog and helped her with her analysis. He created the plot below. You'll learn later how to interpret these boxes, but for now, it's enough to know that each box shows the variety of tips observed for each payment method. For example, the tips from those who pre-paid ("Pre") ranged from $1 to just over $5, with the half of the values between $2 and $4.50.

        <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvC5Rq5aBRMwuHwFsQOBeV1MKZCNDiR9/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

    100. **Data Interpretation:** Based on the analysis, Pizza Girl learned that method of payment does, in fact, affect her tips. From now on, Pizza Girl will focus on deliveries to people who pay in cash, since those customers typically tip between $3 to $4. She’ll also consider making deliveries to customers who pre-pay because she might get lucky and score a big tip.


5. Now it's your turn! To check your understanding of the **Data Cycle**, you will create a Data Cycle Spinner with your interpretation of each component. To create your own Data Cycle Spinner, look for supplies around your home: Cardboard or paper, markers, and something to insert through the center of your spinner to make it spin.

6.  <strong style="color: red;">Create your own spinner. Remember to label each component and to write or draw your interpretation of it (see example below).</strong>

7. The images below contain examples of components of the **Data Cycle** (**Statistical Questions, Consider Data, Data Analysis, Data Interpretation**). For each image you will need to decide which part of the **Data Cycle** is represented. There is no right or wrong answer as long as you provide a sound justification.

8. <strong style="color: red;"> Were you a little doubtful about the statement in image #7c, "Smokers typically have larger lung capacities than non-Smokers"? Why or why not?  What did the spreadsheet in image #7e reveal?</strong>

9. Something to ponder: The conclusion made in slide #7c, "Smokers typically have larger lung capacities than non-Smokers" was a correct interpretation of the visual in #7d. However, it is important to understand on whom the data was collected. As slide #7e reveals, the data included youths whose ages ranged from 3 to 19 years old. So yes, children usually have smaller lung capacities than adults (smokers or non-smokers). The take-away here is to carefully consider who your data represents.
   

10. You can enter the **Data Cycle** at any stage. For example, we can be given a data set and, after considering the variables, come up with statistical questions that can be answered with the data. In the exercise below, you will enter the **Data Cycle** at the analysis stage because a graph has been created from the data that was collected.

11.  The *Bros & Dudes Graphics* handout contains 10 pairings of graphs. The graphics were created for the *Quartz* website by Nikhil Sonnad as a data visualization. He collected the data via Twitter. The graphics
show how common certain terms are throughout the United States when referring to friends.([LMR_1.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.5_Bros & Dudes Graphics.pdf))

    <strong style="color: red;">Choose one of the graphics and come up with 2 questions that could be asked given the particular graphic you chose.</strong>

12. <strong style="color: red;">Create a small Data Cycle graphic using ONE of your questions to turn
    in for assessment (suggested size is 8.5”x11”). The cycle should be clearly labeled and
    have appropriate responses for each of the 4 components.</strong> Some examples have been provided below:
