##***<u>Lesson 4: The Data Cycle</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will learn about the Data Cycle and will understand what a statistical question is.

###**Vocabulary:**
data cycle, statistical questions, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    A statistical investigation consists of cycling through the four stages of the Data
    Cycle. Statistical questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate
    data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data
    through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected
    data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical questions. Data Analysis is almost
    always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the
    data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical questions.

###**Lesson:**
1. During the past few lessons, we have discussed what data are, how to collect and organize them,
and how their values can vary. But what do we do with all this data? How can we navigate it and
turn it into something useful to us?

2. Today, you will be learning about the **Data Cycle**. The Data Cycle is a guide
we can use when learning to think about data. We always start with asking questions. Here is a
graphic of *The Data Cycle* ([LMR_1.3](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.3_Data Cycle.pdf)):

3. Below is an overview of each component of the **Data Cycle**. We will explore each component more explicitly throughout the course.

    100. **Statistical Questions:** Statistical questions are questions that address variability and
    can be answered with data.

    100. **Data Collection:** This is the process of observing and recording data, or of examining
    previously collected data to make sure it meets the needs of the investigation.

    100. **Data Analysis:** During analysis, tables, graphs, and summaries of the data are produced
    to help us find patterns and relationships.

    100. **Data Interpretation:** The statistical questions are answered by referring to the tables,
    graphs, and summaries made in the Data Analysis phase.

4. To help you get a firm understanding of the Data Cycle and how each component is
connected, you will create a Data Cycle Spinner.

5. To create your own Data Cycle Spinner, look for supplies around your home.

6. Create your own spinner (see example below).
    
        <img src="../../img/10406.png" />

7. Almost all statistical investigations begin with statistical questions. There are times when the
questions may be given to us, so we might start at the data collection step, but this should be our
starting point. No matter where we start, our goal is to get all the way around the cycle at least
once. If we can't, we should try to change our approach so that we can get around the entire
cycle.

8. Suppose we ask a person, "How old are you?" We will use our spinner to determine if this is a
statistical question.
    
    100. Since this is a question, we point the spinner to "Statistical Questions."

        **Note:** This is not a statistical question, so we're going to see why not.
    
    100. The person would give an answer – their age. This is data (one observation), so we spin
    the pointer to "Data Collection."
    
    100. This is all the data we need to answer the question, so we spin the Data Cycle to “Data
    Analysis” to see if we could create some sort of graph or table to display this information.
    
    100. However, we only have one data value, so it would be impossible to create anything from
    it (and we don't need to, because we have everything we need to know in order to
    answer the original question).

    100. Therefore, we cannot complete the “Data Analysis” component and are not able to move
    on to “Data Interpretation.”

    100. We need to move backwards through the cycle to figure out what went wrong. In this
    case, what went wrong is that our question was not statistical. It didn’t address variability.

9. So let's change our question to a statistical one: "How old are the students in
our class?"

    100. Next we spin to “Data Collection.” Our data would consist of all of the students in the
    class. There would be different values: probably ages between 14 and 19.

    100. We then spin to “Data Analysis”. Is there a graph or a summary we might make? YES!
    We might make a dotplot of the ages, for example.

    100. Then we spin to "Data Interpretation." We might use the graph from the analysis to say,
    "Students are many different ages, but the typical age is..."

    100. From here we could spin to “Statistical Questions” and try to come up with additional
    questions to answer and repeat the Data Cycle again.

10. The *Bros & Dudes Graphics* handout contains 10 pairings of graphs. The graphics shown on the handouts were created for the *Quartz* website by Nikhil Sonnad as a data visualization. He collected the data via Twitter. The graphics
show how common certain terms are throughout the United States when referring to friends.([LMR_1.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.5_Bros & Dudes Graphics.pdf))

11.  Choose one of the graphics and come up with 2 questions that could be asked given the particular graphic you chose.

12. Write down the 4 components of the Data Cycle, then
use your spinner to see if you can make it all the way through with your chosen questions. You
should record notes about whether or not each component can be completed, and why.

    100. Create a small Data Cycle graphic using ONE of your questions to turn
    in for assessment (suggested size is 8.5”x11”). The cycle should be clearly labeled and
    have appropriate responses for each of the 4 components.

    100. Your graphic must make a conclusion about why your question was or was not a
    statistical question.

13. If you have questions that are not statistical, reformulate them into statistical
questions for homework.
