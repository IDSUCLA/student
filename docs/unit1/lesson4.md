##***<u>Lesson 4: The Data Cycle</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn about the Data Cycle and its components.

###**Vocabulary**
data cycle, statistical questions, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    A statistical investigation consists of cycling through the four stages of the Data
    Cycle. Statistical questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate
    data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data
    through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously collected
    data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical questions. Data Analysis is almost
    always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and numerical summaries of the
    data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer the statistical questions.

!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    For every single lesson:
    
    Answer the questions in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> font in your Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Journal.

###**Lesson**
1. During the past few lessons, we have discussed what data are, how to collect and organize them,
and how their values can vary. But what do we do with all this data? How can we navigate it and
turn it into something useful to us?

2. Today, you will be learning about the **Data Cycle**. The Data Cycle is a guide
we can use when learning to think about data. We typically start with asking questions. Here is a
graphic of *The Data Cycle* ([LMR_1.3](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.3_Data Cycle.pdf)):

3. Below is an overview of each component of the **Data Cycle**. We will explore each component more explicitly throughout the course.

    100. **Statistical Questions:** Statistical questions are questions that address variability and
    can be answered with data.

    100. **Consider Data:** This is the process of observing and recording data, or of examining
    previously collected data to make sure it meets the needs of the investigation.

    100. **Data Analysis:** During analysis, tables, graphs, and summaries of the data are produced
    to help us find patterns and relationships.

    100. **Data Interpretation:** The statistical questions are answered by referring to the tables,
    graphs, and summaries made in the Data Analysis phase.

4. To help you get a firm understanding of the **Data Cycle** we will begin with the story of Pizza Girl. Pizza Girl delivered pizza in Austin Texas. What is unique about Pizza girl is that she kept a blog where she recorded detailed notes of how she spent her time at work. While pizza girl was in the pizza shop, she was paid by the hour, but when she went out to make deliveries, she had to clock out and the only money she made was what she received in tips. This got Pizza Girl thinking: "How is my time most profitably spent?" To help her answer this big question, she began considering her tips.

    100. **Statistical Question:** Does method of payment affect my tip?
    
        Pizza girl wondered if it was worth her time to make deliveries for customers paying with a credit card, cash, check or for those that had pre-paid. In other words, she was wondering who were better tippers.

    100. **Consider Data:** The image below shows how Pizza Girl recorded her data.

    100. **Data Analysis:** Pizza Girl made an attempt to analyze her data but wasn't completely happy. Coincidentally, a statistician that was searching for good pizza came across her blog and helped her with her analysis. This is the graph that he produced:

    100. **Data Interpretation:** Based on the analysis, method of payment does affect Pizza Girl's tip. Pizza Girl will make deliveries when the method of payment is cash because they typically tip between $3 to $4. She will also consider making deliveries to customers who pre-pay because she might get lucky and score a big tip.


5. To check your understanding of the **Data Cycle**, you will create a Data Cycle Spinner with your interpretation of each component. To create your own Data Cycle Spinner, look for supplies around your home.

    100. Cardboard or paper, markers, something to insert through the center of your spinner to make it spin.

6. Now it's your turn! 

    <strong style="color: red;">Create your own spinner. Remember to label each component and to write or draw your interpretation of it (see example below).</strong>

7. The images below contain examples of components of the data cycle (**Statistical Questions, Consider Data, Data Analysis, Data Interpretation**). For each image you will need to decide which part of the data cycle is represented. There is no right or wrong answer as long as you provide a sound justification. 
    
    100. <strong style="color: red;">Where in the data cycle are we? Explain.</strong>

8. <strong style="color: red;"> Were you a little doubtful about the statement in image #7c - "Smokers typically have larger lung capacities than Non-Smokers"? Why or why not?  What did the spreadsheet in image #7e reveal?</strong>

9. Something to ponder: The conclusion made in slide #7c - "Smokers typically have larger lung capacities than Non-Smokers" was a correct interpretation of the visual in #7d. However, it was important to understand who the data was collected on. As slide #7e revealed, the data included youths whose ages ranged from 3 years old to 19 years old. So yes, children usually have smaller lung capacities than adults (smokers or non-smokers). The take-away here is to carefully consider who your data represents.
   

10. You can enter the **data cycle** at any stage. For example, we can be given a data set and after considering the variables, come up with statistical questions that can be answered with the data. In the exercise below, you will enter the data cycle at the analysis stage because a graph has been created from the data that was collected.

11.  The *Bros & Dudes Graphics* handout contains 10 pairings of graphs. The graphics were created for the *Quartz* website by Nikhil Sonnad as a data visualization. He collected the data via Twitter. The graphics
show how common certain terms are throughout the United States when referring to friends.([LMR_1.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.5_Bros & Dudes Graphics.pdf))

    <strong style="color: red;">Choose one of the graphics and come up with 2 questions that could be asked given the particular graphic you chose.</strong>

12. <strong style="color: red;">Create a small Data Cycle graphic using ONE of your questions to turn
    in for assessment (suggested size is 8.5”x11”). The cycle should be clearly labeled and
    have appropriate responses for each of the 4 components.</strong> Some examples have been provided below:
