##***<u>Lesson 5: So Many Questions* [The Data Cycle: Ask Questions]</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will deepen their understanding of statistical questions.

###**Materials:**
1. *Statistical Questions Scenarios* handout ([LMR_1.6_Statistical Questions Scenarios](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.6_Statistical Questions Scenarios.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
statistical questions

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Statistical questions address variability.

###**Lesson:**
1. Entrance Slip (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)): Each student should submit a
ticket that displays the 4 components of the Data Cycle.

2. Inform students that they will continue to learn about what makes a question statistical. Have
them recall the definition of a statistical question: Statistical questions are questions that address
variability and can be answered with data. A good way to determine this is to ask: *Do we need to
see the data to answer the question?*

3. Remind the students of the 2 questions from the previous lesson, noting that one of the questions
was a statistical question, and the other was not:

    100. How old am I?

    100. How old are the students in my school?

4. In pairs, ask students to analyze each question using the definition of a statistical question and
come to an agreement about which one is a statistical question.

5. Using Agree/Disagree (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)), ask a pair of students
for their results. Discuss why the first question **IS NOT** a statistical question (<span style="color:grey">***there is only one
possible value***</span>) and why the second question **IS** a statistical question (<span style="color:grey">***not all students are the
same age. The ages vary, so there is variability in the data***</span>).

6. Distribute the scenarios in the *Statistical Questions Scenarios* handout ([LMR_1.6](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.6_Statistical Questions Scenarios.pdf)) by assigning
one scenario per student team. Scenarios can be used with more than one team.

7. Using the definition of a statistical question, student teams will discuss and explain what makes
each question in each scenario a statistical question. Recorders in each team will capture team
members’ responses while the teacher circulates the room to check for understanding.

8. Select a few teams to share their responses. Students in the audience will listen to the
presentations and jot down whether they agree or disagree with the presenting team’s
assessment of statistical questions. Be sure to discuss disagreements before moving on to
different questions.

9. Inform students that, in the [next lesson](lesson6.md), they will begin using the Data Cycle to learn about their
food habits. To prepare for this, students should begin collecting the “Nutrition Facts” labels from
foods/snacks they typically eat.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Ask students to bring at least 2 cutouts of the “Nutrition Facts” labels of the snacks they typically eat (e.g.,
chips, yogurt, blended drinks, etc.).

**<u>Note:</u>** An alternative to collecting “Nutrition Facts” labels is to print them from an online source and bring
the printouts to class.
