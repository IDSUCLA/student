##***<u>Lesson 5: So Many Questions* [The Data Cycle: Ask Questions]</u>**

###**Objective:**
You will deepen your understanding of statistical questions.

###**Vocabulary:**
statistical questions

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Statistical questions address variability.

###**Lesson:**
1. <strong style="color: red;">What are the 4 components of the Data Cycle?</strong>

2. You will continue to learn about what makes a question statistical. Recall the definition of a statistical question: Statistical questions are questions that address
variability and can be answered with data. A good way to determine this is to ask: *Do we need to
see the data to answer the question?*
<strong style="color: blue;">Include more examples and non-examples from the TR_Statistical Questions pdf</strong>

3. Below are the 2 questions:

    100. How old am I?

    100. How old are the students in my school?

4. <strong style="color: red;">Analyze each question using the definition of a statistical question and
come to a decision about which one is a statistical question.</strong>

5. The first question **IS NOT** a statistical question because there is only one possible value. The second question **IS** a statistical question because not all students are the same age. The ages vary, so there is variability in the data.

6. The *Statistical Questions Scenarios* handout contanins 4 different scenarios with a set of statistical questions.Choose the scenario that interests you the most. ([LMR_1.6](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.6_Statistical Questions Scenarios.pdf))

7. <strong style="color: red;">Using the definition of a statistical question, explain what makes
each question in the scenario you chose a statistical question.</strong>

8. Below, you will find a student's responses to one of the scenarios. <strong style="color: red;">Do you agree or disagree with the student's assessment of statistical questions?</strong>

9. In the [next lesson](lesson6.md), you will begin using the Data Cycle to learn about your
food habits. To prepare for this, you should begin collecting the “Nutrition Facts” labels from
foods/snacks you typically eat.


###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Collect at least 2 cutouts of the “Nutrition Facts” labels of the snacks you typically eat (e.g.,
chips, yogurt, blended drinks, etc.).
