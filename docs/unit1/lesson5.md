##***<u>Lesson 5: So Many Questions* [The Data Cycle: Ask Questions]</u>**

###**Objective**
You will deepen your understanding of statistical questions.

###**Vocabulary**
statistical questions

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    Statistical questions address variability.

!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    For every single lesson:
    
    Answer the questions in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> font in your Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Journal.

###**Lesson**
1. During the previous lesson, you were introduced to the data cycle. <strong style="color: red;">List the 4 components of the Data Cycle.</strong>

2. You will continue to learn about what makes a question statistical. Recall the definition of a statistical question: 

    Statistical questions are questions that:<ul><li>address
    variability</li> <li>can be answered with data</li></ul> A good way to determine this is to ask: *Do we need to
    see the data to answer the question?*

3. The following are examples of non-statistical questions that can be modified to be statistical questions.

4. **Non-statistical**:  What is LeeAnn's favorite color?  While this can be answered with data (by asking LeeAnn), it does not address variability, since LeeAnn presumably has only one favorite color.

    **Statistical**: What is the most common favorite color in our classroom?  This can be answered by collecting data (asking each student his or her favorite color) and recognizes that different students may have different answers.

5. **Non-statistical**: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow (a swallow is a bird)?  This is non-statistical because it assumes all unladen swallows have the same velocity. A follow-up question, such as "African or European?" might point out that there is variation between species, but were we to collect data, we would see variation between individuals.  This question could be rephrased into a statistical question:

    **Statistical**: What is the typical (or most common, or most extreme, or....) airspeed velocity of an unladen European swallow.


6. The *Statistical Questions Scenarios* handout contanins 4 different scenarios with a set of statistical questions. Read through scenarios #2 - #4 and choose the scenario that most interests you.

7. Below, you will find a student's responses to scenario #1. <strong style="color: red;">Do you agree or disagree with the student's assessment of statistical questions?</strong>

8. <strong style="color: red;">Using the definition of a statistical question, explain what makes
each question in the scenario you chose a statistical question.</strong>

9. In the [next lesson](lesson6.md), you will begin using the Data Cycle to learn about your
food habits. To prepare for this, you should begin collecting the “Nutrition Facts” labels from
foods/snacks you typically eat.


###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Collect at least 2 cutouts of the “Nutrition Facts” labels of the snacks you typically eat (e.g.,
chips, yogurt, blended drinks, etc.).
