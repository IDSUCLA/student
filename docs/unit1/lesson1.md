##***<u>Lesson 1: Data Trails</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn what data are, how they are collected, and possible effects of sharing data.

###**Vocabulary**
data, data trails, observations, privacy

###**Essential Concepts**


!!! note "Lesson 1 Essential Concepts"
    Data are a collection of recorded observations. Data are gathered by people and
    by sensors. Patterns in data can reveal previously unknown patterns in our world. Data play a large and
    sometimes invisible role in our lives.

!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    For every single lesson:
    
    Answer the questions in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> font in your Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Journal.

###**Lesson**

1. Watch the *Target Story* video:<br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4")

2. Now that you've watched the *Target Story*, answer the question at the end of the video in your IDS Journal: 

    <strong style="color: red;">How do you think Target knew about the daughter? In other words, how did Target know
    the daughter was pregnant before her father did?</strong>

3. Ponder the following questions about **data** (respond in your IDS Journal):

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What are **data**?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Where do data come from?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Give an example of data.</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Give an example of something that is not data (e.g., something that was never written
    down or recorded in some way).</strong>

4. We create **data trails** as we go through life. A data trail is the data
collected about us as individuals that could be used to see the patterns in our personal lives.
You will learn about your own data trails by keeping a Data Diary for 24 hours. It is likely that you do not realize how often you leave
a data trail or what information is being collected about you on a regular basis.

5. For the next 24 hours, you will log entries into a Data Diary.

    You will write down everything that you do over the next 24 hours that could potentially provide someone with electronic personal data about you, without you necessarily choosing to give him/her your information. Be sure to read the directions and look at the examples in the *Data Diary* document (Click here to access this document, then make a copy and fill it in: [LMR_1.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A4TTCyrjb5nY0MkQXYKkjubNt-yGETqGBrFTiqMp7wE/copy?usp=sharing)):

6. Your teacher will check your Data Diary in order to assess your understanding of data.

7. Do you ever wonder about what happens to your data? Watch this video, *Terms and Conditions*:<br>

8. After watching the video, answer the following questions in your IDS Journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What terms in the **privacy** statements were concerning or worrisome?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Do you usually read the agreements when you download phone apps?</strong>

###**Reflection**
What do human beings do to help them remember what they have learned? They reflect. Reflection is careful thought about a particular subject. Your reflections are your thoughts. Therefore, after every 2-3 lessons you will be asked to reflect on your learning. Make sure you are detailed in your reflection, as this will help guide your teacher in understanding how to best support your learning.
