##***<u>Lesson 1: Data Trails</u>***

###**Objective:**
You will understand what are data, how they are collected, and possible effects of sharing data.

###**Vocabulary:**
data, observations, data trails, privacy

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Data are a collection of recorded observations. Data are gathered by people and
    by sensors. Patterns in data can reveal previously unknown patterns in our world. Data play a large, and
    sometimes invisible, role in our lives.

###**Lesson:**

1. Watch *The Target Story* video:<br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSA-6BJkx4")

2. How do you think Target knew about the daughter? In other words, how did Target know
    the daughter was pregnant before her father did?

3. 

    100. What are **data**?

    100. Where do data come from?

    100. Give an example of data.

    100. Give an example of something that is not data (e.g., something that was never written
    down).

4. Explain to the students that we create **"data trails"** as we go through life. A data trail is the data
collected about us as individuals that could be used to see the patterns in our personal lives.
Inform the students that they will learn about their own data trails by keeping a data diary and
logging entries over the next 24 hours. It is likely that students do not realize how often they leave
a data trail or what information is being collected about them on a regular basis.

5. Distribute the *Data Diary* handout ([LMR_1.1](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.1_Data Diary.pdf)) and be sure to go over the instructions, along with
the first example to give the students an idea of how to proceed.

6. Inform the students that you will collect the handouts during the next class in order to assess their
understanding of data.

7. To get students thinking about what happens to their data, show the *Terms and Conditions* video:<br>
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcjtEKNP05c")

8. Engage the students in a whole class discussion about the video, particularly noting:

    100. What terms in the **privacy** statements were concerning or worrisome?

    100. Do you read the agreements when you download phone apps?

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were. Be prepared to facilitate a good discussion and to ask probing questions in order
for students to elaborate on their thinking so that vague responses such as “we learned about
data” can be avoided.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students will complete the *Data Diary* handout. When grading the homework, be aware of
whether the data really could be collected, and whether the students' ideas about how the data
might be used are reasonable. For instance, students will often imagine that there is a "spy"
watching them; this is not what we are after. We are after actual instances in which sensors or
electronic surveillance records their actions or records information about them. For example,
"someone saw me going into the store" is not valid data for this exercise, but "a camera recorded
me entering the store" is valid data.
