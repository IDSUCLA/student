##***<u>Lesson 8: Tangible Plots* [The Data Cycle: Analyze Data]</u>**

###**Objective**
You will learn how distributions help us organize and visualize data values, and that the shapes of
the distributions give us information about the variability of the data.

###**Vocabulary**
x-axis, y-axis, visualization, range, minimum, maximum, frequency, distribution, typical, symmetric, range,
data points, dotplot

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Distributions organize data for us by telling us (a) which values of a variable were
    observed, and (b) how many times the values were observed (their frequency).


###**Lesson**

1. <u>**Food Habits Campaign Data Collection Monitoring:**</u>

    100. The IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool is found on your IDS Homepage.
    Click on **Monitor** and sign in if prompted. Find the Food Habits Campaign and click on Monitor.
    Note: If you haven't submitted any data, the page will be blank. 
    <strong style="color: blue;">Insert video of accessing and using Monitoring Tool here.</strong>

    100. Your teacher will be monitoring your class' data collection using the Campaign Monitoring Tool. You will have the opportunity to look at your own data collection with the Monitor Tool. Once the campaign collection window is over, and your teacher shares the class data, you will be able to see your class' progress.

        200. See *User List*. <strong style="color: red;">How much data have you collected so far?</strong>

        200. See *Total Responses by Day*. <strong style="color: red;">When did you submit your first response?</strong>

        200. See *App Type by User*. <strong style="color: red;">What do you notice?</strong>

        200. <strong style="color: red;">What can you do to increase your data collection?</strong>

2. Today you will be learning how to visualize data.

3. Watch the *Value of Data Visualization* video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc"),
which describes the importance of graphical representations of data. As you watch the video,
respond to the following in your DS journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What is data visualization?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">List one example of how visualization can be used to increase data comprehension.</strong>

4. The video’s last statement was: “Your message is only as
good as your ability to share it.”

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What does this statement mean?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What makes a good message in terms of data and visualizations?</strong>

5. Find your nutrition facts labels or pictures, and your *Food Habits Data
Collection* handout (from [lesson 6](lesson6.md)).

6. We will create visuals using the nutrition labels collected by the stick figures. To create a visual, we begin by drawing the **x-axis**
and **y-axis** to create the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.

7. Next, the nutrition labels are placed where they belong on the coordinate plane.

8. The stick figures have selected 2 numerical variables and 1 categorical variable from the *Food Habits Data Collection* handout whose data they would like to see in a **visualization**, which is a
picture of the data.

9. We will create **visualizations** with the nutrition facts labels for each of the variables they selected and then you will create a visual of a nutrition fact that wasn't chosen.

10. We will begin by creating a **visualization** of the categorical variable <i>salty_sweet</i>. Since the variable has two categories, we will label the x-axis with the categories <i>Salty</i> and <i>Sweet</i>. The y-axis will have the label **frequency**,
which simply means the number of times an outcome occurs. Tick-marks are not needed on the y-axis because the frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted.

11. The stick figures placed their nutrition fact labels above the category that described their snack. Notice how they have stacked their nutrition label so that is easy to calculate the frequency. <strong style="color: red;">Where would you place your nutrition labels?</strong>

    Since the labels are different sizes, we will create a bargraph to get a better representation of the frequency in each category.

12. Respond to the following questions in your DS journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">How many **data points** does this distribution have? Why?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What information is this visualization telling us about the type of snacks the stick figures consume?</strong>

13. We will now create a **visualization** for one of the numerical variables chosen by the stick figures.

14. The stick figures are interested in analyzing the amount of grams of sugar in the snacks they consume. A plot with a numeric x-axis is appropriate for this variable. Before the x-axis can be labeled, the **minimum** and **maximum** values for the grams of sugar need to be determined so we can clearly label the x-axis with adequate intervals and the variable’s name. The y-axis will be labeled **frequency**, which simply means the number of times a value
occurs. There is no need to place tick-marks on the y-axis. The frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted.

15. The stick figures walked over to the coordinate plane, looked for the number on the x-axis that represented the grams of sugar in their snack and placed their nutrition label above that value. <strong style="color: red;">Where would you place your nutrition labels?</strong> 

    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELkFhZxe12MiyaCcABYob3iJjEYMDLtr/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

16. Observe the **distribution** of grams of sugar. Respond to the following questions in your DS journal:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What are the minimum and the maximum values of the data set?</strong>

    100. **The range** is the largest value minus the smallest value. It is one way of measuring the
    variability of a variable. <strong style="color: red;">What is the range, and why do you think this measures the variability?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">How many **data points** does this distribution have? Why?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What is the amount of grams of sugar that appears most often in a snack? Why?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the phrase *distribution* of the *data set* means?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What information is this distribution telling us about the grams of sugar in the snacks the stick figures consume?</strong>

    100. A distribution tells us two things: the values of the variable and the frequency of the
    values. "Frequency" is just another way of saying "the count." <strong style="color: red;">Why is this dotplot a
    picture of the distribution of grams of sugar?</strong>

17. You will be provided with an opportunity for feedback on your responses.

18. Below is the distribution of number of calories in the stick figure's snacks.

    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z89mxtS3wrAZ-6dLrWf9fA-ushsfhPgq/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">How many **data points** does this distribution have? Why?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What is the number of calories that appears most often in a snack? Why?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What information is this distribution telling us about the number of calories in the snacks the stick figures consume?</strong>


19. We are going to show you how to convert the nutrition facts labels into something more readable. We can represent each label with an item such as a dot, dot sticker or a sticky note.

    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13tlfZDbiUCQ_caqAqhgpHWVFo_CWVc1S/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

20. Notice that the x-axis is the same as before. We simply replaced each nutrition fact label with a dot that corresponded with the number of calories in the snack. If two snacks had the same amount of calories, we simply stacked the dots. <strong style="color: red;">Is this new plot better than the original?</strong> We call this type of plot a **dotplot** since we’re using dots to represent each observation.

21. The *Tangible Plot* handout ([LMR_1.9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.9_Tangible Plot.pdf)) contains the nutritional information for the total grams of fat in the stick figures' snacks. Create a dotplot that shows the distribution of grams of fat and answer the questions. <strong style="color: blue;">Replace LMR_1.9.</strong>
