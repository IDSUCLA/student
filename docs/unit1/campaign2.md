##**Campaign Guidelines â€“ Time Use**

###**1. The Issue**
There have been many reports lately about people spending a large amount of time interacting with
technology and the Internet. This raises some questions about time use:

1) How do I spend my time?
    
2) Is there a difference between how females and males spend their time?

3) Do we spend too much time doing homework?

4) How is my time use similar to or different from other Americans?

###**2. Objectives**
Upon completing this campaign, you will have compared yourself to the rest of the U.S. population to
find how you are similar to and/or different from other people in terms of time use. You will use
single and multivariable plots, summary statistics, and frequency tables to find similarities and
differences between yourself and other groups of students, as well as other students in the U.S.

###**3. Survey Questions** 
Enter data only for the activities in which you participated:

**When?** You will complete surveys four times each day. It is recommended you complete your surveys according to the following schedule: before school, after school, in the evening, and before bed. You can set a reminder to make sure that you complete each survey.

**How Long?** Four times a day for five days. Ideally, 2 of these days would include a weekend.

###**4. Motivation**
Use the <span style="color:blue"><u>Interactive Time Use graphic</u></span> to explore how Americans spend their time.

You should collect time-use data at least twice per day (four times a day makes for better data) during the collection period. After the first day, your teacher will use the Campaign Monitoring Tool to see who in your class has collected the most data. A few days after this, your teacher will show you the Total Responses by Day plot so that you can discuss any patterns you see in the data.

Be ready to discuss data collection issues. What makes it hard? Does this affect the quality of data? Are they any snacks that you haven't entered? 

###**5. Technical Analysis**
RStudio and American Time Use Graphics Single/Multivariable plots: histograms, bar graphs, scatterplots, etc.
Numerical summaries: mean, median, MAD, standard deviation. Frequency tables: One and two-way
tables.

###**6. Guiding Questions**
1) On average, how long do you think you spend on homework?

2) Do males or females take longer to groom themselves?

3) Are there groups of students who spend their time similarly to one another?

###**7. Report**
You will complete a practicum in which you answer a statistical question based on the time-use
data collected.
