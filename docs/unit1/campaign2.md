##**Campaign Guidelines – Time Use**

###**1. The Issue:**
There have been many reports lately about people spending a large amount of time interacting with
technology and the Internet. This raises some questions about time use:

1) How do I spend my time?
    
2) Is there a difference between how females and males spend their time?

3) Do we spend too much time doing homework?

4) How is my time use similar or different to other Americans?

###**2. Objectives:**
Upon completing this campaign, students will have compared themselves to the U.S. population to
find how they are similar to and/or different from other people in terms of time use. They will use
single and multivariable plots, summary statistics, and frequency tables to find similarities and
differences between groups of students, and between students and other residents of the United
States.

###**3. Survey Questions:** (students will enter data only for the activities in which they participated):

| **Prompt**                                                          |**Variable**| **Data Type**                   |

**When?** Surveys will be completed four times per day. It is recommended that surveys be completed
before school, after school, in the evening, and before bed. Reminders can be set to ensure survey
completion.

**How Long?** Five days. Ideally, 2 of these days would include a weekend.

###**4. Motivation:**
Use the <span style="color:blue"><u>NY Times’ interactive Time Use graphic</u></span> to explore how Americans spend their time.

Every student should collect time-use data at least twice per day during the collection period. After
the first day, use the Campaign Monitoring tool to see who has collected the most. After 2 to 3 days,
direct students’ attention to the Total Responses by Day plot and comment on any patterns (see Food
Habits Guidelines for sample).

Discuss data collection issues. What makes it hard? Does this affect the quality of data? What sort
of snacks are less likely to enter?

###**5. Technical Analysis:**
RStudio and <span style="color:blue"><u>New York Times</u></span>. Single/Multivariable plots: histograms, bar graphs, scatterplots, etc.
Numerical summaries: mean, median, MAD, standard deviation. Frequency tables: One and two-way
tables.

###**6. Guiding Questions:**
1) On average, how long do students think they spend on homework?

2) Do males or females take longer to groom themselves?

3) Are there groups of students who spend their time similarly to one another?

###**7. Report:**
Students will complete a practicum in which they answer a statistical question based on the time-use
data collected.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework & Next Day**</p>
For the next 5 days, students will collect data using the Time Use campaign on their smart devices or via
web browser.

<u>***Data Collection Monitoring***</u>

1. **<u>Data Collection Monitoring:</u>** Display the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool, found at
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org") Click on **Campaign Monitor** and sign in.

    100. See *User List* and sort by *Total*. Ask: Who has collected the most data so far?

    100. Click on the pie chart. Ask: How many active users are there? How many inactive users
    are there?

    100. See *Total Responses*. How many responses have been submitted?

    100. Using TPS, ask students to think about what they can do to increase their data collection.

2. Inform students that you will conduct another data collection check with the whole class in a
couple of days, and that they will understand the private vs. shared data after they have
completed the campaign collection.
