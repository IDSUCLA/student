##***<u>Lesson 16: Categorical Associations</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn to construct, interpret, and calculate the joint relative frequencies of two-way frequency
tables.

###**Vocabulary**
two-way frequency table, joint relative frequency

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    A two-way table is a summary of the association/relationship between two
    categorical variables. Joint relative frequencies answer questions of the form "what proportion of the
    people/objects had *this* value on the first variable and *this* value on the second."

###**Lesson**
1. Read the following scenario:

    Rosa has a theory that cat owners are also musical. To find out, she decided to
    collect data that would help her understand the relationship between cat
    ownership and instrument playing among the students in her art class. She
    conducted a survey and found that out of the 35 students in her art class, 16
    owned a cat and out of those that owned a cat, 7 played an instrument. She also
    discovered that 9 owned a cat, but did not play an instrument. There were also 9
    students who neither owned a cat nor played an instrument.

2. Rosa asked two questions that provided the data for her two-way frequency
table. <strong style="color: red;">What could those two questions be?</strong>

3. <strong style="color: red;">What variables did Rosa collect? What were the values of those variables?</strong>

4. <strong style="color: red;">In your IDS journal, summarize Rosaâ€™s findings in one table that shows totals. Use your knowledge of data structures from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md), especially organizing in rows
and columns.</strong>

5. Today you will be looking at associations in categorical variables. Recall that categorical variables represent values that have words.

6. There are many ways to organize the data that Rosa collected. The table below shows a **two-way frequency table**. A two-way
frequency table displays the data that pertains to two categories from one group. One category is
represented in rows and the other is represented in columns. This **two-way frequency table** represents the
data Rosa collected from the students in her art class.

    **Cat Ownership and Instruments**

7. <strong style="color: red;">Based on the Cat Ownership and Instruments table, generate a couple of questions that
can be asked and answered by the data.</strong>

8. A two-way frequency table can show relative frequencies. A **relative frequency** is
how often something occurs in relation to the total number of occurrences, and is expressed as a
proportion or percentage of a total. 

    For example, the **relative frequency** of those who own
    a cat and play an instrument is <span style="color:grey">***7/35 or 0.2 or 20%.***</span>

9. The relative frequencies for the entire table have been calculated.

    <strong style="color: red;">What is the difference between a two-way frequency table and a two-way relative frequency table?  When would it be better to use one over the other?</strong>

10. Using the table above, answer the following questions about relative frequencies:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What percent of the students in Rosa's art class own a cat?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What percent of the students in Rosa's art class do not own a cat but play and instrument?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What does the **relative frequency** 18/35 represent?</strong>

11. <strong style="color: red;">Now you will generate 2 questions about 2 categorical variables of your choosing. Do not choose two random categorical
variables. Rather, you should choose two categorical variables that you predict might be
associated.</strong>

    Example: I think there is a relationship between watching scary movies and drinking soda, so I am going to survey family and friends by asking the following questions:

    Do you like watching scary movies?
    Do you drink soda?

12. <strong style="color: red;">Create a two-way table where you can organize the data for your questions.</strong> This is the two-way table for the example above.

    Example:

    |  | **Likes scary movies** | **Does not like scary movies** | **Total** |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | **Drinks soda** |  |  |  |
    | **Does not drink soda** |  |  |  |
    | **Total** |  |  |  |

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>

Survey at least 20 people (family or friends) and ask them to answer the two questions you generated so that you can fill out your two-way table.
