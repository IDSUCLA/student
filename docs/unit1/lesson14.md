##***<u>Lesson 14: Variables, Variables, Variables</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn how to read and interpret multiple variable plots: bivariate scatterplots, multiple
variable scatterplots, stacked bar plots, and side-by-side bar plots. They will summarize their learning
about multiple variable plots using a four-fold graphic organizer.

###**Materials:**
1. *Scatterplot of Heights & Weights* ([LMR_1.13](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.13_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights.pdf))

2. *Scatterplot of Heights & Weights, Split by Gender* ([LMR_1.14](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.14_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights & Gender.pdf))

3. *Side-by-Side Bar Chart* ([LMR_1.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.15_Side-by-Side Bar Chart.pdf))

4. *Faceted Histogram of Height by Gender* ([LMR_1.16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.16_ Faceted_Histograms_v4.1.pdf))

5. *Summarizing Multi-Variable Plots graphic* organizer ([LMR_1.17](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.17_Summarizing Multi-Variable Plots.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**

scatterplot, grouping, side-by-side bar plot

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    To examine whether two (or more) variables are related, we can plot their
    distributions on the same graph.

###**Lesson:**

1. Begin by informing students that there will learn how to make visual displays using more than one
variable, and by asking them to ponder the following questions:

    100. What do you think is the relation between people’s heights and weights?

    100. Are taller people heavier? Always? Or is this just a tendency?

    What do you think is the relation between people's heights and weights? Are taller people
    heavier? Always? Or is this just a tendency? Let's look at some data.

2. Display the following plot to the class ([LMR_1.13](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.13_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights.pdf)) so they can see some actual data:

3. Ask students to individually answer the following questions about the plot on the handout
([LMR_1.13](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.13_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights.pdf)):

    100. What kind of plot is this and how will you remember its features? <span style="color:grey">***Scatterplot.***</span>

    100. How many variables are displayed in this plot? Name the variable(s) and identify the type
    of variable(s). <span style="color:grey">***Two variables. Weight in kilograms and height in meters. Numerical
    variables.***</span>

    100. What do the axes show? <span style="color:grey">***The x-axis shows the height of teens in meters, and the y-axis
    shows the weight of teens in kilograms.***</span>

    100. Do taller people weigh more? <span style="color:grey">***Not necessarily, but there is a tendency for this to be
    true.***</span>

4. Discuss this plot with the class by eliciting students’ responses to the questions. Students actively
listen to the discussion by confirming, correcting, or adding to their own responses.

5. Close the discussion by asking students: What questions might you have about this plot? What
additional information would be helpful?

6. Now, suppose we could see which of these dots represented girls and which represented boys.
Where do you think most of the girls' dots would be relative to the boys?

7. Display the following plot to the class ([LMR_1.14](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.14_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights & Gender.pdf)):

    Who weighs more? Is the association between height and weight the same for
    boys as it is for girls?***</span>

9. Discuss this plot with the class by eliciting students’ responses to the questions. Students actively
listen to the discussion by confirming, correcting, or adding to their own responses. Follow-up
