##***<u>Lesson 14: Variables, Variables, Variables</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn how to read and interpret multiple variable plots: bivariate scatterplots, multiple
variable scatterplots, stacked bar plots, and side-by-side bar plots. You will summarize your learning
about multiple variable plots using a four-fold graphic organizer.


###**Vocabulary**

scatterplot, grouping, side-by-side bar plot

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 14 Essential Concepts"
    To examine whether two (or more) variables are related, we can plot their
    distributions on the same graph.
    

###**Lesson**

1. In this lesson you will learn how to make visual displays using more than one
variable. Begin by pondering the following questions:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">What do you think the relationship is between people's heights and weights?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Are taller people heavier? Always? Or is this just a tendency?</strong>

2. Let's look at the following plot ([LMR_1.13](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.13_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights.pdf)), which has real data relevant to these questions:

3. In your Data Science Journal, answer the following questions about the plot from the handout
([LMR_1.13](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.13_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights.pdf)):

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What kind of plot is this and how will you remember its features? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> How many variables are displayed in this plot? Name the variable(s) and identify the type(s)
    of variable(s). </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What do the axes show? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> Do taller people weigh more? </strong>
    

4. Check your understanding of this first plot:
    100. **Scatterplot**.
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Two variables. Weight in kilograms and height in meters. Numerical variables.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The x-axis shows the height of teens in meters, and the y-axis shows the weight of teens in kilograms.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Not necessarily, but there is a tendency for this to be
    true.***</span> 
    
        Confirm, correct, or add to your own responses.

5. <strong style="color: red;">Now that you have identified some components of this plot, what additional questions might you have about it? What
additional information would be helpful? </strong>

6. Now suppose we could see which of these dots represented girls and which represented boys.

    <strong style="color: red;"> Where do you think most of the girls' dots would be relative to the boys? </strong>

7. Look at the following plot that addresses this question ([LMR_1.14](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.14_Scatterplot of Heights & Weights & Gender.pdf)):

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> What kind of plot is this and how will you remember its features? </strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;"> How many variables are displayed in this plot? Name the variable(s) and identify the type(s)

9. Check your understanding of this plot:
    100. **Scatterplot**.
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Three variables. Weight in kilograms and height in meters are numerical variables. Gender is categorical.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***The x-axis shows the height of teens in meters, and the y-axis shows the weight of teens in kilograms.***</span>
    100. <span style="color:grey">***Some questions might be "Who is taller, boys or girls?", "Who weighs more?", or "Is the association between the height and weight the same for boys as it is for girls?".***</span>
    
        Confirm, correct, or add to your own responses. 
    
        
        **Note**: When the data are split into categories, it is called **grouping**.
