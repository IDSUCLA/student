#Unit1, Section3: Would You Look at the Time! 
Instructional Days: 9

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Enduring Understandings**</p>
Data are useful for evaluating claims and reports. Summaries of categorical and numerical data show
important features and patterns in the data. Data summaries provide evidence to make claims.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Engagement**</p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data about daily time-use of Americans. Students will
explore the *New York Times* multimedia graphic titled *How Different Groups Spend Their Time* to spark
their curiosity about how they spend their own time. The graphic can be found at
[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0 "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0").

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins> 

S-ID 5: Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way frequency tables. Interpret relative
frequencies in the context of data (including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).
Recognize possible associations and trends in the data.

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

*<u>Data Science:</u>*

Understand that data are collected and stored in particular formats. Before data can be analyzed, it must
be cleaned so it can be read.

*<u>Applied Computational Thinking Using RStudio:</u>*

• Create tabular displays of categorical data and summaries of numerical data.

• Create two-way frequency (and relative frequency) tables.

• Use RStudio to calculate joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies.

• Subset data frames and create new categorical variables from numerical variables.

• Clean and polish data to make it readable.

*<u>Real-World Connections:</u>*

Make claims that are based on data and begin to evaluate reports that make claims based on data.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>

1. Students will use complex sentences to construct summary statements about their understanding
of data, how it is collected, how it is used, and how to work with it.

2. Students will engage in partner and whole group discussions and presentations to express their
understanding of data science concepts.

3. Students will use complex sentences to write informative short reports that use data science
concepts and skills.

4. Students will read informative texts to evaluate claims based on data.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Data File or Data Collection Method**</p>
*<u>Data Collection Method:</u>*

**Time-Use Participatory Campaign:** Students will monitor the amount of time they devote to activities
such as sleeping, studying, eating, and partaking in media.

*<u>Data Files:</u>*

1. Students’ *Time-Use* campaign data

2. American Time-Use Survey (ATUS) data
