##***<u>Lesson 17: Interpreting Two-Way Tables</u>***

###**Objective**
You will calculate conditional, marginal, and joint frequencies and explain what they mean in the
context of the data.

###**Vocabulary**
marginal (relative) frequency, joint (relative) frequency, conditional relative frequency

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 17 Essential Concepts"
    Marginal (relative) frequencies tell us about the distribution of a single variable.
    Conditional relative frequencies tell us about the distribution of one variable when "subsetting" the other.

###**Lesson**
1. **<u>Time Use Campaign Data Collection Responses:</u>**

    100. Today is the last day to collect data for the *Time Use* campaign. You will be using the **Campaigns** tool to view your survey responses. Click on the **Campaigns** tool on your IDS Homepage, found at
[https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org") and sign in if prompted. Find the *Time Use* campaign and click on **Responses**.

    100. Click on the blue plus sign to expand the surveys you have submitted. 
        200. <strong style="color: red;">For which days have you collected data?</strong>

        200. <strong style="color: red;">Do the total number of minutes for each day add up to approximately 1440?</strong> 

        200. <strong style="color: red;">What patterns are you noticing?</strong>

        **Note**: If you forgot to include an activity for one of the days, simply submit another survey, making sure to select the correct day and include the activity.
        
2. In [Lesson 16](lesson16.md), you created 2 questions and a two-way table that would help you organize the data generated by your questions. You also collected data by surveying at least 20 people.

3. You will come back to your frequency table at the end of this lesson.

4. You also learned in [Lesson 16](lesson16.md) how to calculate relative frequencies. Now it’s time
to look at other ways of understanding a two-way frequency table.

5. Here are the *Cat Ownership and Instruments* tables from [Lesson 16](lesson16.md):

6. Suppose that we want to know the following information:

    100. How many students own a cat? <span style="color:grey">***16***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students who own a cat? <span style="color:grey">***16/35 ≈ 0.46 ≈ 46%***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students who do not play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***18/35 ≈ 0.51 ≈ 51%***</span>

7. Notice that the answers to the questions were located in the margins of the table and therefore are called **marginal frequencies**. The margins are the row and the column that show the total. Questions 6b and 6c are **marginal relative frequencies** because they are calculated from a subtotal that is divided by the grand total.

8. Now suppose that we want to know the following information:

    100. How many students own a cat and play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***7***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students that own a cat and play and instrument? <span style="color:grey">***7/35=0.2=20%***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students who neither own a cat nor play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***10/35 ≈
    0.286 ≈ 29%***</span>

9. Notice that the answers to the questions were located in the cells in the body of the table and therefore are called **joint frequencies**. Questions 8b and 8c are **joint relative frequencies** since they are being expressed out of a total number of occurrences.

    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12yuTTCRV2QHFrraYEA-HFab6psPnC3A8/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>


10. Finally, suppose that we wanted to answer this question: Do a greater proportion of students in
Rosa’s art class who do *not* own cats prefer to play an instrument than those who *do* own cats?

11. In this case, the total for the “No cats” row
is important because we are only concerned with that subset of the group. Compare the values that show the **conditional relative frequency** for the row. Slightly more non-cat owners than cat owners play an instrument (53% vs 44%).

    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cczCmgbGN8-VnpHKr2JOg7QX0VLFWfSg/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

    
    **Note**: This is a conditional relative frequency by row. We can also calculate conditional relative frequencies by column if we were interested in knowing the difference in cat ownership for those students who play instruments.

12. The two-way frequency table below shows which emotion males and females associate with the color red.



    **Gender and the Color Red**

    | |Love | Anger | Fear |Total |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
    | Male| 7 | 11 | 5 | 23 |
    | Female| 12 | 15 | 10 | 37 |
    | Total| 19 | 26 | 15 | 60 |

13. <strong style="color: red;">Ask 4 questions about the data in the table above that must be answered by a:</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">marginal frequency</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">marginal relative frequency</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">joint relative frequency</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">conditional relative frequency (either by row or column)</strong>

###**Reflection**
<strong style="color: red;"> Write a paragraph summarizing the most important things you learned in the last 2 lessons. </strong>
