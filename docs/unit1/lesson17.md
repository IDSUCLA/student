##***<u>Lesson 17: Interpreting Two-Way Tables</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will calculate conditional, marginal, and joint frequencies and explain what they mean in the
context of the data.

###**Materials:**
1. Poster paper

2. Markers

3. *Analyzing Categorical Variables* ([LMR_1.18](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.18_Analyzing Categorical Variables.pdf))

    **Advanced preparation required** (see step 19 below)

4. *Interpreting Categorical Variables* ([LMR_1.19](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.19_Interpreting Categorical Variables.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
marginal frequency, joint frequency, conditional relative frequency

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Marginal (relative) frequencies tell us about the distribution of a single variable.
    Conditional relative frequencies tell us about the distribution of one variable when "subsetting" the other.

###**Lesson:**
1. **<u>Time Use Campaign Data Collection Monitoring:</u>**

    100. Display the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool, found at 
    [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")<br>
    Click on **Campaign Monitor** and sign in.

    100. Inform students that you will be monitoring their data collection again today.

        200. See *User List* and sort by *Total*. Ask: Who has collected the most data so far?

        200. Click on the pie chart. Ask: How many active users are there? How many inactive
        users are there?

        200. See *Total Responses*. How many responses have been submitted?
        
        200. Using TPS, ask students to think about what can they do to increase their data
        collection.

2. Remind students that this is the last day to collect data.

3. Ask student teams to take out the 2 questions and the two-way table that they created in the
previous day’s lesson.

4. Before teams ask the class their questions, ask them to strategize about how they will collect and
record their data, because they can only ask the 2 questions.

5. Students in the class will respond to each question by raising their hands.

6. In a *Whip Around*, have each team ask their 2 questions. Pause briefly between teams so that the
asking team has time to collect and record their data.

7. Students will use their frequency tables before the end of the lesson.

8. Recall that in the previous lesson, students learned to calculate relative frequencies. Now it’s time
to look at other ways of understanding a two-way frequency table.

9. Display the *Cat Ownership and Instruments* table:

    **Cat Ownership and Instruments**

    |  | **Plays an instrument** | **Does not play instrument** | **Total** |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | **Owns a cat** | 7 | 9 | 16 |
    | **No cats** | 10 | 9 | 19 |
    | **Total** | 17 | 18 | 35 |

10. Suppose that we want to know the following information (display questions):

    100. How many students own a cat? <span style="color:grey">***16***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students who own a cat? <span style="color:grey">***16/35 ≈ 0.46***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students who do not play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***18/35 ≈ 0.51***</span>

11. In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate
it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the
information. <span style="color:grey">***Possible answer: You would find the proportion of students who do not play
an instrument by dividing the number in the “Total” row that is in the "Does not play
instrument" column by the total number of students (35).***</span>

12. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Mark up the margins on the table to
show that the cells with the initial total counts are called **marginal frequencies**. Note: 10 b and c
are marginal relative frequencies.

13. Now suppose that we want to know the following information (display questions):

    100. How many students own a cat and play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***7***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students that own a cat and play and instrument? <span style="color:grey">***7/35=0.2***</span>

    100. What is the proportion of students who do not own a cat and play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***10/35 ≈
    0.286***</span>

14. In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate
it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the
information. <span style="color:grey">***Possible answer: You would find the answers in the cells that make up the
body of the table. The value for each proportion is the frequency for each cell over the
total number of observations.***</span>

15. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Mark up the cells in the body of the
table to show that the cells with the initial counts are called **joint frequencies**. Note: 13 b and c
are joint relative frequencies.

16. Finally, suppose that we wanted to answer the question: Do a greater proportion of students in
Rosa’s art class who do not own cats prefer to play an instrument than those who do own cats?

17. In teams, discuss where on the table you would find this information and how you would calculate
it. The specific answers are not important; but what is important is to know how to obtain the
information.

18. After a few minutes, ask a team to volunteer a response. Encourage students to agree or
disagree with the explanations provided. Lead students to see that the total for the “No cats” row
is important because we are only concerned with that subset of the group. Mark up “No cats” row
on the table to show that we have conditioned, or are bound, by this variable. Compare the
values that show the **conditional relative frequency** for the row. More non-cat owners slightly
prefer to play an instrument (display table below).

    **Cat Ownership and Instruments**

    **Conditional Relative Frequencies by Row**
    
    |  | **Plays an instrument** | **Does not play instrument** | **Total** |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | **Owns a cat** | 7/16 ≈ 0.44 | 9/16 ≈ 0.56 | 16/16 ≈ 1.00 |
    | **No cats** | 10/19 ≈ 0.53 | 9/19 ≈ 0.47 | 19/19 ≈ 1.00 |
    | **Total** | 17/35 ≈ 0.49 | 18/35 ≈ 0.51 | 35/35 = 1.00 |

    **<u>Note:</u>** This is a conditional relative frequency by row. We can also calculate conditional relative
    frequencies by column if we were interested in knowing the difference in cat preference for those
    who play instruments versus those who don’t.

19. Distribute one full set of cards from the *Analyzing Categorical Variables* file ([LMR_1.18](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.18_Analyzing Categorical Variables.pdf)) to each
student team.

    **<u>Advanced preparation required:</u>**

    Print the *Analyzing Categorical Variables* file ([LMR_1.18](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.18_Analyzing Categorical Variables.pdf)). The handouts can then be cut into a
    total of 20 cards (12 visuals, 8 numerical summaries). You will need enough sets of the cards for
    each student team to share one full set. For example, if there are 5 student teams in a class, then
    5 copies of the file will need to be printed so that each team gets all 20 cards.

    <div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0_preview/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.18_Analyzing Categorical Variables.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_1.18](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.18_Analyzing Categorical Variables.pdf)</div>

20. Distribute [LMR_1.19_*Interpreting Categorical Variables*](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.19_Interpreting Categorical Variables.pdf) to each student team.

    <div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0_preview/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.19_Interpreting Categorical Variables.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_1.19](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.19_Interpreting Categorical Variables.pdf)</div>

21. Each student team will work together and decide which visualization(s) and numerical summaries
can be used to answer each statistical question. They will then answer each statistical question,
citing a numerical summary as evidence.

    **<u>Note:</u>** Student teams may tapeu or glue visuals and numerical summaries onto [LMR_1.19](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.19_Interpreting Categorical Variables.pdf), or they
    can simply write the plot letter and table number in the appropriate box. The blank column is for
    student teams to write a statistical question than can be answered with a visual and a numerical
    summary that was not used.

22. After student teams have been allotted ample time to complete [LMR_1.19](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.19_Interpreting Categorical Variables.pdf), lead a class
discussion to go over the answers. It is extremely important to have students justify their answers
by referring to their visuals and tables. For example, the statistical question “How many students
neither own a cat or play an instrument?” can be answered with Plot E, Plot G, Plot K, Plot I, and
with Tables 1 and 7.

23. Ask students to refer back to the two-way frequency tables they created earlier. Have each team
create one poster that shows their two-way frequency table. Then, ask each team to ask 4
questions about the data in their table that must be answered by a:

    100. marginal frequency

    100. marginal relative frequency

    100. joint relative frequency

    100. conditional relative frequency (either by row or column)

24. If time permits, pair teams up and ask them to present their findings to each other.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework & Next Day**</p>
Using the data below, generate 2 questions: one must be answered with a marginal relative
frequency and the other must be answered by a conditional relative frequency.

Gender and the Color Red

Which emotion do you most relate with the color red?

| |Love | Anger | Fear |Total |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Male| 7 | 11 | 5 | 23 |
| Female| 12 | 15 | 10 | 37 |
| Total| 19 | 26 | 15 | 60 |
