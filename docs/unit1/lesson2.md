##***<u>Lesson 2: Stick Figures</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn how to observe, record, and organize data.

###**Vocabulary**
collect, record, organize, representations, variables

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Lesson 2 Essential Concepts"
    Data consist of records of particular characteristics of people or objects. Data can
    be organized in many different ways, and some ways make it easier than others for achieving particular
    purposes.
    
!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    For every single lesson:
    
    Answer the questions in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> font in your Introduction to Data Science (IDS) Journal.

###**Lesson**
1. Reflect on your data collection homework:

    * <strong style="color: red;">How many observations did you make?</strong>

    * <strong style="color: red;">Where do you leave the most data trails?</strong>

    * <strong style="color: red;">What could someone learn about you if that person had all of this data?</strong>

2. You are going to act as a researcher and **collect** data on a strange group
of people who appear to be completely two-dimensional. Your goal is to **record** as much
information as possible about these people, and then **organize** the information in any way you
choose.

3. Meet the Stick Figures (Click here to access this document and download a copy: [LMR_1.2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8LDPiSP0YdwRzwy4dPszzMQoyLwY9BewXqWcVs5GqY/copy?usp=sharing)):

4. <strong style="color: red;">Select one of the Stick Figures and record all possible information about that Stick Figure.</strong>

5. <strong style="color: red;">Organize the data from all 8 Stick Figures into a visual that you think represents the data.</strong>

6. The images below are **representations** of the Stick Figures' data created by previous IDS students:<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ewr8UZ04CNXjKl7FEnpT_q3hu1ho6xy1/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe></iframe>

7. As you look at the representations:

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Describe some similarities among the team posters and your visualization. Were the data organized in similar
    ways?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Describe some differences among the team posters and your visualization. How were the data organized
    differently across the visualizations?</strong>
 
    100. <strong style="color: red;">What information was available about the Stick Figures on each card?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Which representations made it easy to see what (or who) the objects were that were
    observed? Which representations made it easy to see whether different Stick Figures had
    different characteristics?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">Which representation makes it easiest to see which Stick Figure is tallest?</strong>

    100. <strong style="color: red;">If you were handed a blank Stick Figure and knew only the person's name, could you fill in
    the rest of the information?</strong>

8. The general categories of information about a person or thing, such as a personâ€™s height, are
called **variables**. Variables are simply characteristics of an object or person. As statisticians, we
use variable names to organize data into a simplified form so that a computer can read them.
This will be discussed further in [Lesson 3](lesson3.md).
