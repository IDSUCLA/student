##***<u>Lesson 5: Time Perception Experiment</u>***

###**Objective**
You will engage in a collectively designed experiment.

###**Materials**
2. RStudioâ€™s **stopwatch()** function

3. [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) or Browser-Based survey-taking tool

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts"
    Designing and carrying out an experiment helps us answer specific statistical
    questions of interest.

###**Lesson**
1. List the elements of an experiment (you may refer back to [Lesson 2](lesson2.md)).

2. In this lesson you will be using RStudio to get a precise measurement of your estimate of how long one minute is.

3. Login to RStudio to see what the stopwatch function does by typing in the following command *<u>but don't press the enter/return key on the keyboard</u>*: 


    **> stopwatch()**

4. Once you've typed in the command, get ready to estimate the length of time of one minute without looking at a clock. When you're ready to start, press enter/return on your keyboard. Once you think a minute has passed, press the enter/return key to see the result of your estimate.

5. You will measure your one-minute estimates using the RStudio **stopwatch()** function.

6. Review the research question:

    **How does our perception of time change when exposed to a stimulus?**

7. Go back to the experiment you designed and review all the elements.

8. For our experiment, your teacher will determine if you are in the treatment or control group. If you are in the treatment group, the treatment/stimulus is the one your teacher assigned to you. If you don't have one assigned, you will be in the treatment group, and the stimulus you will be engaging in is keeping your head down by bringing your chin down toward your chest while you estimate how long one minute is.

9. If you are in the control group, you will simply close your eyes. Each student in the group will run the **stopwatch()** function and stop the timer when they believe a minute has elapsed.

10. Be prepared to record the time RStudio measures for your estimate of one minute in your IDS Journal. Ready, set, GO!

11. After recording your estimate in your IDS Journal, answer the following question:

    **<strong style="color: red;">Reflect on your experience. How did the treatment affect your perception of one minute of time?</strong>**  

12. You will now enter your data in the *Time Perception* survey found in the Survey Taking tool at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org") or by using the [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) in your iOS or Android device.

13. You will be analyzing the results from the *Time Perception* survey in *[Lab 3A: The Results
Are In!](lab3a.md)*
