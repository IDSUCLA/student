##***<u>Lesson 6: Observational Studies</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn that an observational study is a data collection method in which subjects are observed
and outcomes are recorded. You will learn how to collect this type of data and make informal inferences
about the results.

###**Materials**
1. *Stick Figures Cutouts* ([LMR_1.2_Stick Figures](https://ucla.box.com/s/rvgj4fv3qncvqyo0wf7o9onyb3vtdcf0)) from [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md), [Lesson 2](../unit1/lesson2.md)

    **Note:** Advanced preparation required** (see step 1 below).

2. *Turning Observations into Data* handout ([LMR_3.2_Observations_to_Data](https://ucla.box.com/s/ebm3me9pxharpjnaes6xpn5hqcu7w9u4))

###**Vocabulary**
observational study

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts"
    Observational studies are those for which there is no intervention applied by researchers.

###**Lesson**
1. Refer back to the *Stick Figures* ([LMR_1.2_Stick Figures](https://ucla.box.com/s/rvgj4fv3qncvqyo0wf7o9onyb3vtdcf0)) handout.

2. Recall that you used these cards in [Unit 1](../unit1/overview.md), [Lesson 2](../unit1/lesson2.md). When you used them in [Lesson 2](../unit1/lesson2.md), the data was collected, recorded, and organized, but without particular structure to it.

3. You will now use the data from the *Stick Figures* ([LMR_1.2_Stick Figures](https://ucla.box.com/s/rvgj4fv3qncvqyo0wf7o9onyb3vtdcf0)) to complete the next activity.

4. <strong style="color: black;">Click on the document name to download a fillable copy of the [*Turning Observations into Data* handout (LMR_3.2)](https://ucla.box.com/s/ebm3me9pxharpjnaes6xpn5hqcu7w9u4) and complete it.</strong>

5. Compare your variables to the ones listed below to find out if you correctly identified them in Part 1 (you did not have to write them exactly this way as long as they are referring to the same variable):

    <strong style="color: purple;">**name, GPA, height, sport, number of friends, shoe type**</strong>

6. In Part 2 of the handout, you organized the data.

    <strong style="color: red;">Refer back to Unit 1, Lesson 3 What is this data format called?</strong>

7. Part 3 of the handout asks you to consider the following research question:

    **What determines the number of friends a person has on social media?**

8. Based on your responses in the handout, answer the following question, then click to check your work:


    <details>
    <summary><strong style="color: red;">Which variable did you think was best associated with the number of friends on social media? Use evidence from your work to justify why you think this was the best variable.</strong></summary>
    A person’s GPA was related to the number of friends (the higher a person’s GPA,the more friends he/she had)
    </details> 


9. The very last question in the handout asks: “Can you think of another variable (not necessarily given in the pictures) that might impact both the number of friends AND the variable you selected? Give an example and explain how it might impact each of the variables.” Ask 3 different people to identify a variable that might impact the number of friends someone can have on social media.

    In your IDS Journal, rank their variables, including the one you selected, from most impact to least impact. Record your explanation as to why you ranked them the way you did.

10. In the previous section, you learned about the elements of an experiment. In your IDS Journal, write a paragraph answering the following question:

    <strong style="color: red;">How is collecting data from the Stick Figures similar to or different than collecting data from experiments?</strong>

    *Important point*: It is necessary to understand that there were no assignments to groups and no treatment was applied to the Stick Figures. The subjects (the Stick Figures) were simply observed, and then information about them was recorded.

11. An **observational study** is a data collection method in which subjects are observed and outcomes are recorded. No treatment is applied to the subjects. Instead, researchers are simply watching something happen and have absolutely no control over it.

12. In [Lesson 7](lesson7.md), you will learn more about the differences between experiments and observational studies and what conclusions you can make about each.
