##***<u>Lesson 9: Survey Says…</u>***

###**Objective**
You will learn that a survey is another data collection method. You will learn what a survey is, what
types of questions are used in a survey, and how a survey is conducted.

###**Materials**
1. Video: *Family Feud’s* “Shocking Fast Money” found at:<br>

2. *Designing a Survey* handout ([LMR_3.4_Designing a Survey](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.4_Designing a Survey.pdf))

###**Vocabulary**
survey, self-reported, open-ended questions, closed-ended questions

###**Essential Concepts**

!!! note "Essential Concepts"
    Surveys ask simple, straightforward questions in order to collect data that can be
    used to answer statistical questions. Writing such questions can be hard (but fun)!

###**Lesson**
1. Introduce one of the videos listed above by informing students that they will be watching a clip
from the television game show *Family Feud*. This segment of the show is called *Fast Money*,
where the winning family plays for an additional $20,000. Two family members are chosen to play
and must reach a combined score of 200 points to win the money. The goal is to guess the most
common responses to five questions. For example, if the question “What animal is a common
pet?” were asked, each family member might answer with “dog” or “cat” since these are popular
household pets. The first person accumulates as many points as possible during the 20-second
first round. The second person is given 25 seconds to earn points with different answers.

2. As you watch the video, answer the following questions in your Data Science Journal:

    100. How many people were surveyed? <span style="color:grey">***100***</span>
    
    100. Who was represented in the survey? <span style="color:grey">***Single men***</span>

    100. How many survey questions were asked? <span style="color:grey">***5***</span>

    100. When the host says “survey said” and we see the response, what does it mean? <span style="color:grey">***It
    means that X number of people out of the 100 gave that response to the survey
    question.***</span>

3. *Family Feud* uses surveys as its main data collection tool. In their DS journals, students should
write down what they know about surveys individually.

4. Then, with a partner, students will share what each one of them knows about surveys.

5. Select a couple of students to either share their response or their partner’s response with the
whole class.

6. Inform students that a **survey** is a data collection method where the data are **self-reported**,
meaning that participants answer questions themselves. Surveys are composed of:

    100. Questionnaires or a series of questions

    100. A representative sample of the population of interest

    100. Carefully worded questions

7. Surveys rely on questions. There are two types of questions that can be asked in a survey: **open-ended
questions** and **closed-ended questions**. Open-ended questions offer a free-response/
text approach, whereas closed-ended questions give a fixed set of choices.

8. Display the following list to the class. With a partner, have the students categorize the following
types of questions as either open-ended or closed-ended:

    (a.) Multiple choice <span style="color:grey">***(closed)***</span>

    (b.) Write a paragraph <span style="color:grey">***(open)***</span>

    (c.) Yes/No <span style="color:grey">***(closed)***</span>

    (d.) Comments <span style="color:grey">***(open)***</span>

    (e.) Essays <span style="color:grey">***(open)***</span>

    (f.) On a scale from 1 to 5 <span style="color:grey">***(closed)***</span>

    (g.) Choose from a list <span style="color:grey">***(closed)***</span>

    (h.) Write a sentence <span style="color:grey">***(open)***</span>

    (i.) Check a box <span style="color:grey">***(closed)***</span>

9. Do a quick *Whip Around* to share the categorization for each type of question. Be sure that
students make corrections to the list if any items were miscategorized.

10. Quickly review the Data Cycle.

11. To give students an introduction to conducting surveys, they will first go through a practice
scenario as a class to try to answer the following research question:

    **What are ‘families’ in the United States?**

12. Distribute the Designing a Survey handout ([LMR_3.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.4_Designing a Survey.pdf)) and let students fill in the boxes for
“Research Topic” <span style="color:grey">***(Families)***</span> and “Research Question” <span style="color:grey">***(What are ‘families’ in the United
States?)***</span>.
<div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0_preview/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.4_Designing a Survey.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_3.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.4_Designing a Survey.pdf)</div>

13. Inform students that the left side of the handout will be completed as a class, and then student
teams will work together to complete the right side.

14. Using the Data Cycle as a guide, students should brainstorm a statistical question that is related
to the research question. One might be: <span style="color:grey">***What is the typical family size in the United States?***</span>

    **<u>Note:</u>** This requires a definition of “family,” which can have a variety of meanings to different
    people. Different definitions will likely guide the discussion of possible survey questions in the
    following step.

15. Next, students need to determine 3 survey questions to help answer the statistical question. The
goal in creating survey questions is to make sure they (1) are unambiguous, and (2) address the
statistical question. Some examples are listed below (which come from different definitions of
“family”):

    **<u>Note:</u>** Survey questions MUST match the statistical question.

    (a.) How many siblings do you have?

    (b.) How many people live with you?

16. It may help to actually collect data once the first survey question has been created. For example:
“How many siblings do you have?” – each student would give a response and the values could be
recorded in a dotplot (if desired). If the question is too vague (do we include half-siblings, step-siblings,
etc.?), students can revise the question.

17. Once the class has agreed upon 3 survey questions for the first statistical question, allow
students to join their student teams for the remainder of the activity.

18. Each team should come up with a statistical question that might answer the research question,
then determine 3 survey questions that match their statistical question. Have the students create
both open- and closed-ended questions in the handout. Each survey question should be a
different type (see Step 8).

19. Have student teams share out their statistical questions and related survey questions with the
rest of the class.

###**Reflection**
<strong style="color: red;">What are the essential learnings you are taking away from this lesson?</strong> 

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework & Next Day**</p>
For homework, students should choose one of their team’s survey questions and rewrite it 3 ways, using
3 different question types (see Step 8). Example rewrites for the statistical question “How many siblings
do you have?” are given below for reference.

<span style="color:grey">***(a.) Multiple choice:***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many siblings do you have? Select one option.***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 0 siblings***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 1 sibling***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 2 siblings***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) 3 siblings***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) more than 3 siblings***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***(b.) Write a paragraph:***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your own words, describe your siblings.***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***(c.) Yes/No:***</span>

<span style="color:grey">***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any siblings?***</span>
