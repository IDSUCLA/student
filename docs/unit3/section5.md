1. Students will use complex sentences to construct summary statements about their understanding
of data, how it is collected, how it used, and how to work with it.

2. Students will engage in partner and whole group discussions and presentations to express their
understanding of data science concepts.

3. Students will engage in discussions regarding internet research as it applies to data science.
