##***<u>Lesson 15: Ready, Sense, Go!</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn what sensors are and how they are used to collect data.

###**Materials:**
1. Video: *Smart Tennis Racquet*<br> [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10827869/Smart-tennis-racquet-records-spin-shots-and-power-in-time-for-Wimbledon.html](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10827869/Smart-tennis-racquet-records-spin-shots-and-power-in-time-for-Wimbledon.html "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10827869/Smart-tennis-racquet-records-spin-shots-and-power-in-time-for-Wimbledon.html")

2. Computers (see Step 5)

3. Poster paper

4. Flags in 3 different colors

    **Advanced preparation required** (see Step 10 below)

###**Vocabulary:**
sensor, trigger, algorithm

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Sensors are another data collection method. Unlike what we have seen so far,
    sensors do not involve humans (much). They collect data according to an algorithm.

###**Lesson:**
1. *Entrance Ticket:* What are some of the data collection methods we have learned about so far in
this unit? <span style="color:grey">***We have learned about experiments, observational studies, surveys, and getting
data from a URL (in [Lab 3B](lab3b.md)).***</span>

2. Inform students that, in this lesson, they will be introduced to another data collection method
known as sensors.

3. With a partner, ask students to discuss what they think a sensor is. Ask each pair to write down
their ideas.

4. Show the *Smart Tennis Racquet* video found at: [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10827869/Smart-tennis-racquet-records-spin-shots-and-power-in-time-for-Wimbledon.html](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10827869/Smart-tennis-racquet-records-spin-shots-and-power-in-time-for-Wimbledon.html "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10827869/Smart-tennis-racquet-records-spin-shots-and-power-in-time-for-Wimbledon.html"). As students watch the video, they should think about other
sensors they may have come across, particularly ones used with smartphones. After watching the
video, ask students to add to their definition of a sensor.

5. Now, inform students that they will work in teams to compile a list of data-collecting sensors. They
may use computers to conduct online research for this part of the lesson. Challenge each team to
generate the longest list in the class.

6. After students have had time to research and create their lists, ask students in each team to
number off one through four (or five, depending on team sizes).

7. Share out in rounds. First, ask students in each team whose number is one to share one sensor
from their list. On the poster paper, create a class list of sensors as shared by the students.
Repeat with the rest of the numbers.

8. Score keeping: Each person gets five seconds to respond. You may hold up your hand with the
palm facing the students and count down. The rules for teams are as follows:

    100. add a sensor to the list, get 1 point

    100. repeat an answer, lose 1 point

    100. do not answer in five seconds, lose a turn

    100. do not have an answer to contribute, may pass

    **<u>Note:</u>** You may reward the winning team with extra credit points, if desired.

9. Next, students will engage in an activity to see sensors in action.

10. Create 3 groups of students:
    100. Group 1 – Triggers (3 students)

        Provide each Trigger a different colored flag (for example: <span style="color:fuchsia">**Pink**</span>, <span style="color:purple">**Purple**</span>, <span style="color:green">**Green**</span>). The
        teacher will call out a color, at random, and the Trigger assigned to that color will raise his
        or her flag. Each flag corresponds to a research question of interest.
        
        <span style="color:fuchsia">**Pink**</span> – Who is in our class?
        
        <span style="color:purple">**Purple**</span> – What is on our classroom walls?
        
        <span style="color:green">**Green**</span> – What do we like to do after school?

    100. Group 2 – Sensors (2 students)
    
        Each Sensor should be assigned to one Trigger, or colored flag (<span style="color:fuchsia">**Pink**</span> = Sensor A,
        <span style="color:purple">**Purple**</span> = Sensor B, <span style="color:green">**Green**</span> = no sensor assigned to it). When the Sensors see their
        assigned Trigger, they send a signal to the Collector (see below) telling him or her to
        collect data about from another student in the class. The Sensors are basically gobetweens
        for the Triggers and the Collector.

    100. Group 3 – Collector (1 student)
    
        One student is the Collector of all the data. The Collector is in charge of asking survey
        questions related to the research question of the original Trigger. Survey questions are
        provided here:
    
        Survey questions related to the <span style="color:fuchsia">**Pink**</span> trigger:
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How did you get to school today (bus, car, walking, etc.)?
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What size shoe do you wear?
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is your favorite pizza topping?
        
        Survey questions related to the <span style="color:purple">**Purple**</span> trigger:
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is your favorite wall decoration?
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What type of poster is it (motivational, reference, class work, etc.)?
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What color is most prevalent in the poster?
        
        Survey questions related to the <span style="color:green">**Green**</span> trigger:
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do you have a sports team practice or club meeting today?
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are you hanging out with friends today after school?
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will you be working today after school?
    
        Each time a sensor is active, the Collector must ask a new student in the class the
        appropriate survey questions.

11. Explain the activity to your students. Then, call out a flag color at random. Repeat several times.
Make sure you call out the flag that has no assignment at least once so that students see that no
action took place. Reflect on the activity with the following discussion questions:

    100. What data were missed? Why? <span style="color:grey">***Data about what our class likes to do after school.
    They were missed because there was no Sensor connected to the Green trigger, so
    the Collector never knew to collect this type of data.***</span>

    100. Grocery stores keep track of customer data when purchases are made with a loyalty card.
    What is the trigger in this case? What data are being collected? <span style="color:grey">***The trigger is checking
    out at a grocery store. There are lots of data that are collected, including: items
    bought, cost of items, number of items on sale, etc.***</span>

12. After they engage in the sensor activity, ask students to revisit their definition of a sensor (see
Step 3). Have them revise their definition based on the following concepts:

    100. A **sensor** is a converter that measures a <u>physical</u> quantity and converts it into a signal,
    which can be read by an observer or by an instrument.

    100. A sensor collects data continuously, or whenever a **trigger** is activated. A trigger is a
    something that responds to an event so that an action can occur.

    100. Sensors collect data according to an **algorithm**. An algorithm is a process or set of rules
    that are followed (just like the rules followed during the activity).

    100. Sensors may also collect data automatically, without anyone’s knowledge or input.
    Examples include GPS location, time, and date.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Now that students learned what sensors are, ask them what data would they like to see collected on
a sensor that they couldn't collect in an experiment or survey. They must explain why it is difficult to
collect that data in an experiment or survey, and how a sensor would make it easier to collect that
data.
