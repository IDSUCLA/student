##***<u>Lab 3A - The results are in!</u>***
Directions: Follow along with the slides and answer the questions in **bold** font in your journal.

###**Conducting experiments**
* Previously in class, you conducted an experiment to gauge how a stimulus affected people's
perception of time.

    – Some people were given a treatment, others were not.

* In this lab, we'll use the data cycle to analyze the *research question*:

    *Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?*

###**Coming up with questions**
* **Write down two statistical questions that will help you answer the *research question*
from the previous slide.**

* Then, *export*, *upload*, *import* your experiment data into RStudio.

    – If you're having trouble coming up with good statistical questions, try loading the
    data and looking at the variables.

    – Ask yourself, *How would I use these variables to answer the research question?*

###**Analyzing our data**
* Create appropriate plots to answer your statistical questions.

    – **Are there any outliers or unusual observations that require some cleaning
    before you can interpret your plots?**

* Calculate appropriate numerical summaries to answer your statistical questions.

* Interpret your plots and summaries.

    – **Write down a few sentences with your interpretations.**

###**Wrapping it up**
* Is it possible your initial results occurred by chance alone?

    – **Use repeated shuffling to determine how likely the typical difference between
    the two groups occurred by chance alone.**

    – **Create a plot and use it to justify your answer.**

* What do you conclude about the *research question*?

    – **Write a report using the plots and analysis you conducted to answer the
    *research question*.**

    – Be sure to describe how you conducted your experiment.
