A survey is a data collection method that is administered to a sample. The sample is fraction of the target
population. The sample must be representative of the population and random sampling is used to ensure
an equal chance of being selected. A census is a special survey that collects data from the entire
population. Sampling error and bias cause problems in analysis made from survey data.

Students will view a video clip from the game show *Family Feud* to begin to think about survey
components. The video can be found at:

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

S-IC 1: Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a
random sample from that population.

S-IC 3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and
observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Understand that bias and sampling error should be minimized when conducting surveys. The wording of
questions, as well as who is asked to participate in a survey, can lead to bias. Learn that sampling error
can be minimized when larger random samples are collected from a population.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking Using RStudio:*</ins>

• Create random samples of different sizes to make estimates about a population.

• Create informal confidence intervals based on sample medians.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will use complex sentences to construct summary statements about their understanding
of data, how it is collected, how it is used, and how to work with it.

2. Students will engage in partner and whole group discussions and presentations to express their
understanding of data science concepts.

3. Students will write questions that emphasize differences in data science concepts and skills.

<ins>*Data File:*</ins>

1. American Time-Use Survey (ATUS) data
