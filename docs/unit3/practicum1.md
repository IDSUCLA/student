##***<u>Practicum: Music to my Ears</u>***

###**Objective:** 
Students will design a simple experiment.

###**Materials:**
1. Practicum: *Music to my ears* ([LMR_U3_Practicum_Music to My Ears](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_U3_Practicum_Music to My Ears.pdf))

**<u>Note to Teacher:</u>** Before assigning the practicum to your students, engage the class in a discussion
about experiments. Use the following questions as a guide to assess student understanding.

1. When is random assignment used? Why is it important? <span style="color:grey">***Random assignment is used when
you wish to determine whether a treatment causes changes in an outcome variable. It’s
important because it creates a “balance” of the groups so that the only way the groups
differ, on average, is that one gets the treatment and one does not. Thus, if there is a
change in the outcome variable, only the treatment could have caused it.***</span>

2. Below are some headlines, determine if they are causal or not. If not causal, re-write so that it is.
If causal, state why it’s causal.

    • Straight A’s in high school may mean better health later in life. <span style="color:grey">***not causal, re-writing
    answers will vary***</span>

    • Murder rates affect IQ test scores: Study. <span style="color:grey">***causal, explanations will vary***</span>

    • Microbe linked to Alzheimer’s Disease. <span style="color:grey">***not causal, re-writing answers will vary***</span>

    • Luckiest people “born in summer” <span style="color:grey">***causal, explanations will vary***</span>

3. Why is a control group important? <span style="color:grey">***The control group is important because it allows us to
measure the effects of the treatment group with an untreated comparable group. Without
the control group, we don't know what would have happened if we had done nothing.
[Think of a new vaccine for the flu. If there is no control group, and we see the treatment
group improving, we will never know if they would have improved anyways, without the
vaccine.]***</span>

In class, you designed and conducted the *Time Perception* experiment to find out if a person’s perception
of time changed when exposed to a stimulus. This experiment was designed so that it used random
assignment, which is the process of using a chance device (e.g., dice, RStudio, etc.) to determine the
placement of subjects into the treatment and control groups. By randomizing, you are removing other
possible explanations for why the results happened the way they did.

Now we are asking you to design an experiment to determine whether doing math homework with music
playing in the background affects student’s test scores. Work with your team to design this experiment.
Submit a paper that clearly lays out your team’s design plan. Be sure to include:

1. Descriptions of each element of the experiment by answering the following questions:

    a. What is the research question we are interested in addressing?

    b. Who are the subjects that would be participating in the experiment? How should we
    select them?

    c. What could be possible treatments? What treatment do you choose and why? What will
    the control group do in your study?

    d. Describe how to randomize the subjects into the treatment and control groups.

    e. What is the outcome variable that we are measuring? Is it categorical or numerical? What
    other variables will you measure for each subject?

2. An analysis plan:

    a. What statistical questions will you ask to address your research question?

    b. What analyses (graphical and numerical) will you use to answer these questions?

    c. An explanation of how you will determine whether the treatment affects test scores.
