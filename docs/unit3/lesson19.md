##***<u>Lesson 19: Implementing Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign</u>***

###**Objective:** 
Students will mock-implement, create their Participatory Sensing campaign, survey on their
topic of interest, then begin data collection.

###**Materials:**
1. *Campaign Creation* handout ([LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation.pdf)) from previous lesson

2. Campaign Authoring Tool ([https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org"))

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Practicing data collection prior to implementation allows optimization of a
    Participatory Sensing Campaign.

###**Lesson:**
1. Display the class generated campaign information for the class the clearly see.

2. In teams, have students mock-implement the campaign they have created. They can do this by
asking each other the survey questions to make sure they make sense/ will generate relevant
data to their research question and statistical questions. They can use the evaluative questions
from [Lesson 17](lesson17.md) step #10.

3. If there are suggestions for improvement, have teams propose them to the class and make final
changes to the campaign.

4. Inform students that you will now demonstrate the tool used to create the campaigns that is
displayed on their mobile devices or computers.

5. Login to the **IDS Home Page** found at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org"). Click on the **Campaigns tab** on
the navigation bar at the top of the page. Then, follow the steps in the tool:

    100. **<u>Campaign Info Window:</u>**

        200. **Campaign Name:** Give your campaign a name. A name related to the topic is
        recommended.

        200. **Select your class/period.**

        200. **Description:** Provide a one-sentence description of your campaign.

        200. **Data Sharing:** Select Disabled in order to monitor for improper responses.

        200. **Campaign Status:** Select Running.

        200. **Click the |<span style="text-decoration: overline underline;">+Add Survey</span>| button.**

    100. **<u>Survey Window:</u>**

        200. **Title:** Give the survey a title (again, it may or may not be the same as the
        campaign name). Users see the title and the all the prompts that follow.

        200. **ID:** Give the survey a name (it may or may not be the same as the campaign
        name). Users do not see the survey ID.

        200. **Description:** Provide a short description of the survey for display.

        200. **Submit Text:** Provide a brief message to be displayed after survey submission.

        200. **Anytime:** Select the checkbox if you want the survey to be available at anytime.

        200. **Click the |<span style="text-decoration: overline underline;">+Add Prompt</span>| button and select the prompt type for your first
        survey question. Note:** You should only select from the following choices:
        Single choice, number, photo, and text. Multiple-choice does not mean select
        one choice; it means select many choices. It is not recommended that multiplechoice
        be used at this point.

    100. **<u>Prompt Information:</u>**

        200. **Click <u>the new prompt bar</u>**.

        200. **Prompt ID:** This will be your first variable. A short one-word name or short twoword
        name separated by an underscore is recommended.

        200. **Prompt Label:** This is the variable name that will be displayed (it may be the
        same as the prompt ID without the underscore, if used).

        200. **Question Text:** Type the survey question about which you want to collect data.
        
        200. **Additional Prompt Information:** Depending on the prompt type, you will be
        asked to enter additional information. For example, if your prompt is Text, you
        will be asked a minimum and a maximum value for the number of characters the
        participant can enter.

        200. **Skippable:** Select the checkbox if you would like the prompt to be skipped. It is
        recommended that photo prompts be skippable, since some users will submit
        their responses via a browser.

    100. **Repeat step c for the remaining survey questions by clicking the |<span style="text-decoration: overline underline;">+Add Prompt</span>|
    button.**

    100. **XML Code:** As you create the campaign, the code that creates it will be displayed. You
    may select the checkbox titled **Enable Syntax Highlighting** so that students can keep
    track of where the information you are adding is embedded in the code. Inform students
    that they will be learning about XML syntax in the next several lessons.
    
    100. **Click the |<span style="text-decoration: overline underline;">Submit Campaign</span>| button on the top, right hand side of the page once all
    prompts have been added.** This action will send the campaign to the server for users to
    see.

6. Once all prompts have been created, students may use their smart devices or login to the IDS
Home Page to view the new campaign. Remember to **Refresh Campaigns**.

7. Students should go through the entire participatory sensing survey to see how their questions are
displayed. They do not have to upload the survey.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
For the next 5 days, students will collect data using their newly created Participatory Sensing campaign.
